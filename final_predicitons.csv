316,"[7, 9]",easy process but problems with booking a fitting appointment  the website made it easy to find the correct tyre specifications for my vehicle  and to place the order  i was offered a number of fitting options and chose ats tyres  then selected a time slot to suit my convenience  unfortunately the time slot i selected was not available at ats and i had to wait a further two days for a convenient time  at which point the tyres were fitted quickly and professionally  would have given five stars apart from being offered a fitting time that they couldn't honour 
317,[9],autowise at bexhill were very good - no complaintsmy only issue was the original planned date had to be changed as the tyres were not available to be at autowise for the original date

323,[4],easy way to fit new tyres  good experience from ordering to the fitting no hiccups just good old job done no quibbles  i have used before might not be the cheapest but the fitting partners win it for me 1 2 miles from home 
324,"[6, 11]",i would definitely recommend  as you can choose the tyres and the price that are suitable for you  also you can choose a local garage which  use to have the tyres fitted  i received an excellent service

331,"[6, 9]",brilliant   from original enquiry to the fitting of the tyres would definitely recommend     
332,"[4, 9]", your appointment system is not fit for purpose i booked wed am but you offered thurs pm as the earliest appointment  you also stated that i should arrive early as the garage operates a first come first served  wrong  they operate an appointment system  mine was for 15 30hrs which you were informed of but failed to pass on  a reoccurring problem i am led to believe  the garage were excellent and revised their schedule to fit me in earlier  still a 3hr wait your quotes for tracking and alignment were totally inaccurate the only positive to come out of this debacle  on the day your tyre price was the cheapest i could find 
333,"[4, 9]",date and venue changed with less than 24 hours notice  the garage ‘couldn’t fit me in’ then when i asked if i could collect the tyre from there and take it to another authorised fitting centre i was told the tyre wasn’t there  how were they going to fit it if it wasn’t there in the first place

387,[9],rubbish not the usual service  the tyres were two days late  and black didn’t do much to help  this meant i would need to go to an alternative fitting station and it was suggested that i pick them up in my car   i contacted the original fitting station who were very helpful and agreed to fit the tyres for me  fitting station 10/10 👍😀  0/10👎🏻 😡 finally i had no follow up from  to explain/apologise for the rubbish “service”

389,[7],quick and easy ordering and fitting was hassle free
390,"[9, 11]",the website was great  had the tyres i wanted at a good price and the options for fitting were great  however  i opted for the  mobile tyre fitter and i chose a fitting in the pm 3 days from when i ordered  granted i did order on a weekend but i was told i could get my tyres  i then got a phone call 5 minutes before 12pm to tell me the tyres would not be fitted that day as they didn't get to the fitter in time   i had arranged a half day off work to do this  not best pleased as the customer service agent didn't seem to bothered to have told me this news and it was ok for tomorrow  just as well my work is flexible enough 
391,None,this was an easy and helpful experience to order in advance the exact brand and quality of tyres  rather than just take what is available  an appointment of my choosing at a convenient location and a quick and efficient job  would definitely choose  again 
392,"[1, 9]",great service all round even able to change the appointment with no fuss
393,[9],after having my order confirmed and booked with supplier i was later informed that neither the order of 4 continental tyres could go ahead and that the booking had to be rearranged

395,[7],convenient  easy and no trouble  very happy with   the local garage it was delivered to was below standard but this was not  issue
396,[4],it would have been 10  if there had been a proper fitting slot rather than an am first come first served
397,[7],good prices  nice hassle free purchase and no faffing around getting them fitted  just turn up at the appointed time and they do them there and then  i was in and out in no time 
398,[9],fitting superb but need more realistic appointment dates  booking experience was a little disappointing  was offered appointments on the website from thursday  so chose the following friday morning   came back to say the garage couldn't carry out the work then  and offered saturday morning instead  which wasn't convenient  to save time  i rang and spoke to a very helpful lady who organised it for first thing on the following wednesday the fitting experience was superb  i arrived  handed over the keys  and just under an hour later  the job was completed and the keys were returned i spoke with the receptionist about the fitting dates  she told me that the delay was due to  not being able to supply the tyres in time for the first date i chose perhaps  should offer more realistic appointment dates to allow enough time for the tyres to arrive at the fitting location 
399,[2],website was easy and quick to use  tyre specs listed along with grades for efficiency and fuel consumption along with noise of the tyre  a mobile tyre fitting option was also available which was perfect for my situation 
400,"[3, 4, 9]",a bench mark of service and fitting to beat all others  a great experience from a respected seller  customer service was also of a high standard  i was kept up to date with the fitting arrangements and although there was a delay on my requested fitting date  cs handled the issue with total professionalism and courtesy  actual fitting of the tyres were done straight away at the local troy branch   is a definite 5 stars for tyre fitting and price  a guaranteed high quality service  recommended 100% and thank you 
401,[9],great service and price from  let down by fitters   price was by far the best i could find  while they delivered my tyres on time  their fitting garage had suffered an equipment failure and had to delay the fitting by three days  this is the only reason for me dropping my rating to four stars 
402,[9],borough 4 tyres and took the rims down the day before as for a classic car and they were fitted that day and rang me at 18 45 to inform me the wheels were ready before the appointment time the next morning brillant
403,[9],there was a bit of confusion between bc and the fitting garage 
404,"[2, 3]",great clear pricing and good choice of availability
405,[11],first time ive bought tyres on line  usually i look for deals usually on budget tyres too then go to the garage & your kind of at the mercy of whats there  i decided to give this a go & go for proper branded tyres & i have to say now theyre on the car it was worth paying that bit extra it drives & handles brilliantly  i had 4  having done it now ill always do it this way   is really easy to use & you can see lots of different makes of tyres & most importantly reviews & ratings on each tyre  once you've chosen what & how many you want it gives you fitting locations & time slots  so you choose your most convenient location & time for fitting  the tyres get delivered to your chosen location  you rock up at the allotted time  they get fitted  job done  great price too  ill definitely use  again & can thoroughly recommend them 
406,[2],first time using   website was quick and easy to use  plenty of tyre choice with specs of each listed along with noise of the tyre  fitting options were good and prices also very competitive  mobile tyre fitting option also available which is what i used  only downside was i had to wait 5 days for them to be fitted 
407,"[4, 9]",good service gone bad  i’ve used  a number of times without incident before  the last time however was plagued with cancelled appointments for a variety of administrative and logistics errors  this was then followed by the vendor damaging one of my wheels and not even mentioning it to me   
408,[9],tyres were fine ats were awfully slow  tyres were fine  ats took ages to fit and missed the booked time slot by 4 hours  rubbish slow service 
409,[2],great  keen and clear prices  good range of product options  convenient  easy access at a place and time of my choice  i will reccomend 
410,[4],the apparent attention to detail and careful fitting done at the pit stop 
411,"[2, 4]",website is very easy to use  products available are very varied  and i returned to a tried and trusted brand  tyres were delivered to the fitting garage and the job was completed satisfactorily  this was followed by a four wheel alignment  at a reasonable price  and my new tyres make the car so much safer and more comfortable to drive many thanks to the guys at mcconechy's in inverness  
412,[9],when i first trued to book i was given a morning slot  i asked  what that meant and they said i could turn up anytine from 8 30 too 11 30  when i booked it i was given an 8 30am appointment  when i asked the garage why this was  they told me that you tell them the appointment time so the actual window of choice didnt exist

423,[9],very helpful when i need to change my order    additional tyres and a change of date    but i would have preferred to have made the changes online rather than by phone  
424,[9],apart from not being able to deliver for the day i requested  they had them there for the next day and contacted to tell me and apologise for the inconvenience  other than this everything was ok 
425,"[1, 9]",very poor customer service
426,"[4, 9, 11]",i am a happy customer yet again with   i'm able to get the exact quality tyres i want and know  fitted at the place i trust  would be five stars except the website still lists the wrong tyre size for my seat so have to know this and manually select the right size  last time around this was only noticed by the fitter immediately the tyres arrived  to their credit  and  were excellent correcting that order    but not yet their fitment database 
427,"[1, 9]",good customer service  i was informed about minor détails that i was not aware of

438,"[4, 9]",bad experience this time  garage didnt balance wheels properly  took car back and they rebalanced- car was even worse  i drove 500 miles to scotland with a wobbly steering wheel  a  dealer in scotland has hopefully sorted it today  i complained and to date no one at  has resolved my complaint after a chase up email sent yesterday  poor service  however this is the first time i’ve had an issue like this hence i’ve awarded a 5 not a 0 which frankly is all you deserve on this showing   
439,"[4, 9]",alignment problems   delivery to installation partner was fine  so far as i know  but two weeks later i am still waiting for their repair of alignment machinery so that alignment can be carried out at the time of tyre fitment  which i view as basic   should monitor these capabilities more closely and help fitment partners to resolve them

632,[4],the tyres in the end are excellent  but fitting them involved two visits as  sent the garage the wrong size tyres  due to mis-labeling  then had to wait on the phone for a long time to report the issue 
633,[1],the service from start to finish the was exemplary
634,[9],there was limiited communication from the customer service  after i picked a time to have my tires fitted  i was not informed that the tire shop canceled this order as the scheduled time had already been filled  i had to call the tire shop to confirm and  customer service barely responded in a timely manner  next time  i will just go to a tyre shop and schedule through them 
635,[9],the tyres were unavailable after purchase  the tyres were noted as unavailable after purchase and delayed by 5 days  the fitting at hayes  thankerton was however great   issues were with customer service which was slow and commutation was split over 3 people  additional compensation delayed due to administration error 
636,"[3, 6]", are very good  i have used them 3 time now and had no problems  very good service and fitting
637,[9],unlikely to use again  ordered 2 tyres  got informed wed 3pm the day before the fitting appointment at 9 30a m on the thurs that the tyres wouldn't be available for fitting until sat  given that i was taking the car on holiday on the fri  i was left to find somewhere else at very short notice to get the tyres i wanted fitted in time  would have given 1 star  but the customer service guy  was really nice and helpful under the circumstances  and sorted out the refund quickly 
638,[2],the service is easy to use  you can book a fitting time to suit you  prices are competitive and knowing the fitting garage is reputable helps confidence hence the best of both worlds  the garage staff i used were helpful and efficient  thank you

651,[11],very easy fitting  smooth  easy experience at a garage you trust  and the tyres cost less than from the big nationals  whats not to like 
652,"[3, 9]",good price and easy online booking let down by careless fitting centre  good price and easy online booking system with tyres available when they say they will be   let down however by poor quality service from the chosen garage/fitting centre  no apparent follow up from  to check the quality of the fitting centre  although i would use  again i will never use that particular tyre fitting centre again  namely howard selby of north berwick  this is the second occasion that they have given shoddy service 
653,[1],brilliant  excellent customer service  great price and great quality
654,[2],the website was so easy to use and i used ats to fit the tyers they where very good so no problem
655,[5],cheap and easy 
656,[9],3 times the fitter didn’t turn up  tardy response from customers services  waiting for final response  still no refund  a disaster
657,"[4, 11]",it is now cheaper to buy tyres on ebay and pay to get them fitted yourself  i have also had problems with the tyres since they were fitted  on went down completely whilst i was out working  causing me to have to go to another fitter and have the wheel shoulder cleaned up and tyre refitted at a cost of £20  the 2nd tyre seems to have a similar problem and goes down slowly 
658,[11],easy  efficient  well-priced service  it gave me a full range of options on tyres and pricing and made it clear the difference between the efficiency of each tyre  i even found a tyre fitter who would travel to me for a small price  excellent 
659,"[4, 9]",i have had a great experience with   i just have an issue with the garage that fitted them  they were trying to add extra jobs of cleaning my alloys and sealing as they advised they were badly corroded for a mere £80 for two alloys  thankfully i refused  i had them checked out by another garage who said they wouldn't charge to do such a thing and that my alloys were fine anyway  stay away from laws tyres  bridge of don    i cant fault  the tyres were a little later than agreed but i was given plenty of notice to re-schedule  communication was great  i will choose  again but deliver to another garage

661,"[0, 9]",fast easy service  no hassle  let me know the appointment time as well 
662,"[7, 9]",easy to order on-line and a great all in price got an appointment slot for a couple of days after ordering  dropped car off and went away for an hour returning to find everything done  staff at garage pleasant and obliging  would definitely use this service again

668,"[4, 9]",the first & last time i will ever use you  i am still waiting for my tyres to be done  you took £190+ from my account straight away  you then cancelled the first job  i complained & was assured it was booked in for a few days later  i was also told i would be refunded for the cost of them coming directly to my house  wiltshire tyres then called me that morning to say they had to chase you up as you had not re-booked my tyres with them  wiltshire tyres then called me again today as they were due to come to my house tomorrow 9am-1pm  they informed me that their driver is sick and now i have to drive my car to andover  to get the tyres fitted  absolutely terrible service and i shall pass my experience on to everyone i know 
669,[9],had my original choice of tyres cancelled  was given another set to choose from which i had no choice but to agree becouse they were the only option available to me  then the next day another email saying i had to change my fitting day becouse the said tyres would not arrive in time  i rang and spoke to a lady and got it sorted eventually and an over of some kind of compensation was given which when the next email arrived nothing was mentioned about  so all in all not very happy at all 
670,"[2, 11]",motorhome tyres  very easy site to use  very competitive price and also the option to get the tyres fitted when and where i chose  also got a discount code for purchasing four tyres  excellent service at tyre spot where i had them fitted

673,[2],very competitive pricing  a good choice of brands and easy tyre fitting arrangement 
674,"[2, 9]",identifying the correct tyres was easier on your site than other sites all this worked well  unfortunately when i went for my appointment the supplier was short staffed and running late so instead of 9 00 am fitting they were fitted at 3 30pm  they did apologise and were very efficient in fitting them  i was unlucky 
675,"[5, 7]",  simple effective order process best price for quality fitted tyres
676,[3],good quality tyres and good experience of getting them fitted fast and very friendly
677,"[2, 11]",very easy to choose tyres of differing types putting your reg in helps to find the exact size which is important as people tend to change to different types —very good communication and massive saving no hesitation in recommending—thank you

681,"[4, 9]",the reg checker was the wrong size and poor service  the reg checker was the wrong size  i went to my fitting and they told me after they'd taken my wheel off  so i'd been there about 30minutes for nothing  then customer service has been very poor via email as have only responded once  fed up to be honest and still have paid for a tyre but have not been contacted to get a new one fitted 
682,[4],did divert now a returning customer  tried the  own brand this time  excellent value  and still look the business on 20's much quieter than my old pzeros started using a mobile tyre supplier and fitter in recent times of needing tyres  but got them fitted at a affiliated garage and definitely better balancing  overall a better experience 
683,[9],i ordered my tyre and was given a installed date of 9am next morning which would have been the monday  i then received an email saying that my tyre was not arriving and they could not give me a date for install  several phone calls over several days an i finally got my tyre installed on the wednesday

687,"[4, 10]",good service by    provided a good service at a good price  only let down was the filters at the local garage they also did a good job but could have been more careful around the cars with jacks and tools and could have taken more care with my diamond cut alloys  they didn’t cause any damage but the potential to have caused damage was quite high 
688,"[8, 10]",easy  good garage  professional and reliable

719,[11], is the only place to buy tyres  huge range of quality products at exceptional prices  from ordering online  booking a date and time  payment and confirmation and then tyres changed professionally by a reputable company  it is a seamless exercise throughout  five star all the way by a company you can trust  have used  for many years  would not consider anywhere else 
720,[7],good price for tyres required  easy online booking  fitting centre staff were welcoming and efficient and after 45 minutes all four tyres had been fitted with no issues 
721,[4],tyres fantastic  service could do with some tweeking as boot was left in a state when tyre fitter was looking for the key for the wheels

726,"[3, 4]",budget quality tyres   good grip on wet weather 
727,[4],never going there again  used the bletchley depot  the service i got was disgusting  the staff were more interested in chatting up the young lass in a skimpy top  took them nearly an hr to change just 2 tyres  wheels were so badly balanced that i had to get them redone  where i also found out that the spigot hub rings had been lost so have been driving a car thats been shaking as i drive 
728,"[8, 9]",great service  but tyre delivery delay meant i needed to rearrange a service and work schedule
729,[10],pricing and local service excellent 
730,"[2, 9, 11]",excellent service  just put in your car reg and select the tyres you want book an appointment at the garage you want to get them fitted at from the list  pay and that’s it  plenty of communication about your appointment  the garage were ready for me with my tyres  fitted them immediately and that’s it  so easy  will always use  
731,[4],questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience  firstly the purchasing experience was not great  i entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car  i was looking for the same bridgestone s001 run flat tyres  the s001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price  i ordered them  instantly i got an email from  saying they think i have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones i ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats  looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive  clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that i had potentially the wrong tyres as i got an automated email from them only once i had placed an order   trapped why not ask at the time of checkout    had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes i had received then onto the fitting  the garage is only a few mins from my house  booked for 8am on a saturday  arrived 7:50am  it then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres  not impressed  then when i drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low  it had about 10 psi less than the rest  so either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air  went back to the garage to get it checked out  no leak just not enough air put in   drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres  i ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump  small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub  you expect some but the alloy was smothered in it  so had to take the car to the cleaners also so in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience 
732,[11],hi  it was easy way to purchase tyres and with promo code i have saved further 5%  thanks
733,[10],good  convenient service from a local garage  at a competitive price
734,[4]," ok mcconechys not ok  ordered up my new tyres from  online  good price and good prompt service from   however  i made a massive mistake in choosing mcconechy's  sighthill  edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters  it is clear that as a  customer and not an actual mcconechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted  you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way mcconechy's fitted my tyres  upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go  i walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted  i then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork a day later i was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that mcconechy's had not even changed the valve stems either  i contacted mcconechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone  i told him that i noticed they had not changed the valve stems  i got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think i would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted  so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but i changed the valve cores though"" i don't believe a word of that  what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know  is that i'm a fully qualified engineer and i know corner cutting when i see it  remember i had to actually request that they fit dustcaps  unfortunately i didn't notice mcconechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or i would have pulled them up right there and then i know why he didn't change the valve stems  it is because they are all rusted up  badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over  maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his bs story about them being metal i paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted  that is not what i got i got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that i don't believe about the valve cores being changed but that makes it ok doesn't it   no  it certainly doesn't  i was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done  the mcconechy's fitter never made any mention of this  i had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm  well when i checked them 50 miles later  the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels  the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far i do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place  more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun  there is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench  the mcconechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter  avoid them  you are not a mcconechy's customer  you are an annoyance to them  you are getting in their way  not at all happy with any of this steven dryden "
735,[10],good service  and a good price
736,"[1, 3]",good price  excellent customer service very knowledgable
737,"[9, 11]",nice not only to be about to order the tyres online and save money but also actually to get a variety of choice with actual reviews so you know which tyres would actually suit my requirements  long gone are the days where the local high street place tells you which overpriced tyres they have in stock or can get in stock 
738,[10],easy service  good comparison for prices

743,"[0, 11]",cheapest by far in my case  good garage choices and all simple to arrange  have used them several times now 
744,[2],good price  easy to do and plenty of local tyre fitting locations 
745,"[2, 10]",quick & easy to access site  large choice of products at various prices  nearby garages and prompt service 
746,[9],staff where polite but when i ordered tyres 2 days later they say not in stock so ok accepted same make of tyre alternative  but when arrived at garage they had recieved my original order and the alternative so some confusion there ringing and re-booking fittings 
747,[4],rude service with attitude at the garage
748,[11],have no issues as such with  and price was better than most  however the garage we selected to get our tyres fitted was horrific 
749,"[2, 3]",excellent easy to use site  very good communication when there was a problem along with competitive prices  great service at the fitting centre 
750,[9],mistake with the delivery of the tyres meant i could not get them fitted on the day i turned up to the fitters  effectively costing me two days  according to the fitter it's not the first time they've had the wrong tyres delivered to them by  
751,[9],price is good and being able to choose which garage to have them fitted is also good  however for my order supposed to be fitted wednesday  was informed won’t be at garage till friday   turned up friday garage said sent the wrong size  informed to go back monday no tyres  they were signed for but delivered to wrong garage  i phoned back tuesday customer service who said they will send out some more tyres and ended up getting them fitted on thursday
752,[9],not as competitive as others and misleading “appointments”  failed to update my order as requested  fitting service very slow
753,"[4, 7, 8]",easy process  quick  professional service installing replacement tyres
754,[7],easy to order and easy to pick place and time for fitting  good competitive price quoted
755,"[3, 6]",price we excellent and the garage owner where i went was second to none
756,[1],quick efficient service well priced
757,"[4, 9]",i had a problem with the fitting centre causing brake dust contamination to the drivers seat which then  through contact  contaminated items of clothing  i rang  and they said they would call me back about compensation and putting it right  that phkne call was due 5 daya ago 
758,[5],great savings on premium tyres    have used  twice and very easy process from start to finish
759,[4],beware when ordering  i was quite excited to find a website which when you put your registration in the tyres which you fit to the vehicle come up  beware i drive a three year old bmw which like most bmw’s come factory fitted with runflats  the website is not specific on this and i mistakenly ordered the non run flat version as the website indicated this was the correct tyre for my car  the service to get the replacement was good and according to the garage which fitted them this happens quite often   you don’t need to offer tube tyres for vehicles with run flats  the run flats should come up as first option 
760,[9],had an hour wait before my car eventually went in however apart from that everything that was done to my vehicle was a***
761,"[0, 11]",good  efficient service  ould ha e got tyres slightly cheaper elsewhere but chose  because of pairing with local garage 
762,[7],straight forward web page  easy to order  tyres all fitted with no issues 
763,"[4, 10]",easy to organise tyres for my car at a price i liked  designated garage did a good job installing my tyres  yes  of course i chose 10

765,[4],tyres bridgestone potenza 205 40 17 for ford fiesta 140 black addition  put two on front as recommended by another ford driver  well tried in f1 against michelin and ferrari used them to take schumacher to many titles so well proven  haven't been far yet with car but away in two weeks so will then then see what they can do 
766,[9],booked appointment not available  i booked the appointment time online which suited me around working hours  i was sent an email the next day saying that they couldn’t do it on that day  i was offered times during the week or the following saturday  due to work commitments i had to take the following saturday which meant rearranging plans   were very effiecent in rearranging  however i don’t see the point in offering appointment bookings online if they can’t be honoured  the garage that fitted the tyres were excellent  i will try  one more time in the future in the hope it doesn’t happen again 
767,[4],waited far too long to change 2 tyres  when i got the car back there was a noise coming from the rear of the vehicle  had to take it to bmw  they said whoever fitted the tyres didn’t do it properly  nit sure what it was myself but bmw fixed the problem for me there and then 
768,"[2, 9]",excellent website  easy to use  information was helpful  relevant and well laid out  prices were excellent and the tyres were available two days later at a garage of my choosing  my local garage that i visited for quotes were so impressed they even said they would take the  deal as it was the best they had heard of 
769,[9],website awful  gives lots of times for appointments and then sends you a text telling you it’s unavailable shortly after completing and paying for an order  you then have to ring up and rearrange everything and chase the operators etc  non stop  awful first time experience
770,"[7, 10]",easy to order quick delivery
771,"[0, 11]",good value  speedy  no fuss  no hard sell extras
772,"[4, 9]",4 stars because of confusion over appointment time and availability of tyres for appointment  once sorted  absolutely no issue and tyres fitted as ordered and supplied  i would recommend   and definitely use again  as long as it wasn't urgent  due to supply to agent times  in my case i had alternative transport and could wait the 4 days for delivery and fitting appointment  however  consumers may need to change tyres quickly to get home  this would not have suited in my situation  with a spacesaver spare and big hole in main tyre sidewall  had i been 200 miles from home  20 miles was ok  then a 4 day wait for tyres 
773,"[8, 9]",great quote for tyre to be delivered and changed at our home address  sorted change in delivery date due to cancellation by garage really quickly and with no fuss  the mechanic who came to fit the tyre was on schedule and efficient 
774,"[4, 7]",needed tyres quick and as close as possible to where i live   delivered on the tyre price and literally with the mobile fitting 
775,[9],fitting of tyres  i my appointment was cancelled because ats were to busy i had a perished tyre and needed to have this done as i was travelling  i was not told the fitting date was at ats descretion  i paid in full and had to wait a further 3 days  ats were very good and put my spare on for me  if you pay for a service you should get it 
776,"[3, 9]",your price are good but i have been let down twice now with the tyres not being delivered to the fitters in time for my appointment 
777,"[3, 4]",service and price good but mobile fitted put 40psi in tyres that should have been 29psi
778,"[3, 7]",great all good nice tyres good price fitted swiftly at the time specified in less than 1 hour 
779,"[4, 9]",having a bmw with staggered wheels it's very difficult to find x 2 pairs of the same tyre in the same place  i was thinking of removing the run flat tyres from our f31 330d for many reasons but this was a job for the future       until on my way home from work 2 days before we went on holiday to france i picked up a puncture  the annoying thing was  the tyres x 4 had loads of life left on them so i had to bite the bullet and change all 4   were amazing  they were quick and professional even to the point where they had realised that i had ordered non runflat tyres and sent me a warning email in case i was not aware of my error  the tyres were delivered the next day to the garage of my choice in lincoln  f1 autocentres even managed to get the car in a day early so as we could be on our way to holiday on time  overall i would highly recommend this service to anyone  not only for the swift professional dispatch of the order but the amount of money we saved compared to using other well known suppliers  thank you  
780,[9],firstly  my tyre was not available on the day i booked  the day before my appointment  i was contacted as the delivery could not be made by the allotted time  this seems like rather poor planning on ' part  i had to change my weekend plans and miss an important event because i couldn't drive the long distance on my tyre that needed to be replaced  secondly  the available locations were confusing  as there were multiple locations for the same business   having chosen one  when i went to the business on the day  no one seemed to be aware of my booking - either in the chosen location  or in the second location i was sent to  only the tyre that i had ordered  led to the staff at the second location being aware of the booking  and so they were able to carry out the tyre change  the booking system appeared robust and i was pleased with the price  the people at the garage were courteous and the service provided at the garage was good  but the above two points really annoyed me 
781,[9],waste of time  tyres were ordered on monday with a appointment for fitment on wednesday they failed to confirm the appointment due to tyres not in stock knowingly they still took the order and held on to my money even tho the tyres were never sent out would avoid waste of time   spent awful lot of time waiting on phone to get connected to customer service   sent numerous emailed not a single reply total disaster   money still hasn’t been refunded even tho they were meant to do a bank transfer same day
782,None,beware of their subcontractors  shower of chyte
783,"[2, 11]",if you know what you want then i would recommend ordering from   it was easy to find the tyres i wanted and to choose a nearby garage to fit them 
784,[3],good price for product and good choice of fitting station  including the one i would have used anyway  so couldn’t fault the service 
785,[3],garage was great and tyres at good price
786,"[6, 11]",this was my first experience of going online to choose my tyre and then make an appointment with a local garage to have the tyre fitted  i chose  because of the good reviews i had already read and hoped it would work well for me  i needn't have had any concerns because after ordering and paying for my tyre and choosing one of the two local garages suggested i was more than happy with the service i received  i would definitely use  again 
787,"[8, 9]",easy to book  guy was really nice  took me bang on time and finished when he said he would  professional 
788,"[1, 2]",excellent service - again  great fitter and reasonable price to suit my convenience
789,"[10, 11]",price was good and garage was empty so done in 15 mins  will buy again and use same garage - just tyres wycombe
790,"[4, 9]",your element was excellent however your approved garage was far from it  i turned up 5 minutes before the agreed fitting time at hiq neathand they didnt seem bothered  after 10 minutes of waiting i asked what was happening and they said they werent too sure as it was nothing to do with them because i bought through   they then decided it was time to take my vehicle into the workshop and eventually after 50 minutes the job was done  i do not excpect to wait 50 minutes for 2 tyres to be replaced  unfortunately they have let you down and would make me think twice about using you again  id rather pay a few quid extra and have a quicker turn around at my normal garage 
791,[9],had to change garage appointment to help them even though at booking it had been free
792,[4],the price was right and when i took the car to the garage the tyres were there waiting to be fitted 
793,"[2, 8]",easy to use website  prompt response and delivery to chosen garage garage was efficient and courteous  
794,[5],best price out there  easy  convenient booking  all sundries covered when fitting the new tyres  no hidden costs  will definitely use again  highly recommended
795,[10],good price  quick delivery  right product
796,[7],helpful  couldn’t be more helpful trying to find a local garage to fit the tyre  thank you
797,[9],great service but only when the tyres turn up  great service from the garage that fitted the tyres  but second time now that the promised fitting date was changed because the tyres hadn’t got there  perhaps i’m unlucky  but this is a cornerstone of the value offered  so  needs to get those tyres to the garage whatever the cost 
798,"[4, 8]",excellent  efficient service   extremely easy transaction pleasant gentleman who came to our house  so very much better than going to some industrial estate in the middle of nowhere 😀
799,"[5, 9]",bit of a wait  no appointment time possible at the fitting centre i used - so had a bit of a wait  other than that - service fine  and price for the tyres unbeatable 
800,"[4, 11]",good tyres at reasonable prices  purchased two hankook ventus prime 3 tyres to replace two chinese unknown brand ones that came with the car and were starting to crack  buying the tyres online from  com was easy and the fitting location was convenient the welcome on arrival was not the warmest as the guy on duty could clearly have benefitted from some customer service training however  his colleague josh  who actually fitted the tyres  was much friendlier and did a good job although i've done comparatively few miles on the tyres thus far  i have noticed they seem much quieter than the old ones and the ride is better overall a positive experience marred only by the curt welcome at the fitting location 
801,[10],great service and good price  
802,[10],good price and good service
803,[10],happy  quick  easy and a good price 
804,"[0, 11]",bought 4 avon tyres for my passat including fitting etc  for £305   excellent value for money 
805,"[3, 8]",excellent price excellent service highly recommended  excellent price  excellent service and all work carried out on the drive  mechanic arrived before expected  tyre changed and still able to get in to work early  a very impressed customer  highly recommended and will certainly use again when required 
806,[6],its quick and it's easy and the people who do the job once you take your car there are amazing   this is the second time i've used  and will be doing so in the future 
807,[2],ease of use  convenience and price
808,[2],booking was a bit of a mess  fitting was great  price was v competitive 
809,"[8, 9]",the staff are incredibly professional and helpful; especially the individual who changed my tyres  the only issue was the wait time when attempting to phone your customer support  but once answered they were very friendly and helpful
810,"[2, 11]",price and ease of access to any tyre you want  also you are able to pick a local garage to fit 
811,"[4, 9]",one tyre went missing  so there was a delay to get the two tyres fitted  the garage a dealt with were fantastic
812,[11],chose 10 as i checked the prices at my local garages and then checked on  the tyres were 40% cheaper at the local garage that i had just checked     exactly why would i not chose or recommend them  will never go anywhere else from now   
813,"[2, 8]",very good site  very quick to use online  wide selection of tyres  wide variety of garages to use and relatively cheap  would highly recommend 
814,[2],very easy to source  compare and evaluate the products and make an informed choice  easy to book and the garage itself was an absolutle pleasure to deal with   price was also better and local fitting was more convenient 
815,[2],the only way to buy new tyres  this is an excellent way to review  source and compare tyres   and to find a local garage to fit them  very easy to use the website and very easy to book an appointment  the garage i used was excellent too  courteous  helpful  informed and prompt staff  a very  very good all round experience with  com
816,"[0, 2]",easy to use website giving good value for money  when i had an issue with the installing garage they stepped in and resolved the problem to my satisfaction
817,"[4, 7]",straightforward process  no fuss  turned up to a partner garage and had brand new tyres put on within an hour or so  very happy with the service
818,"[8, 11]",my tyre get fitted on time exactly which is rarely to happen anywhere  quick and friendly staff with a competitive price 
819,[9],i’m happy with tyres but was disappointed with service this time as i had a 4pm slot booked at the garage  they didn’t even start until half past and it was nearly an hour before i got away  usually only takes 10-15 mins
820,[9],well  it seemed like a good idea  but after emailing to say my reservation time was no longer available and i'd have to reschedule my whole weekend and miss out on using my camper  then get to the garbage and they have no idea that i'm coming  they say the tyre should have been collected on the day it was delivered even though they couldn't fit it  tyre gets fitted but the garage don't even bother putting the spare back in the carrier  they just leave it in the boot  not very impressed at all 
821,[9],prices are good however arranging fitting has some issues  my original choice of fitting station was fine on check out but was quickly changed due to unavailability of the fitting station  the second appointment was then cancelled and rearranged  if this was a one off it wouldn't have been so bad but it's the second time this has happened 
822,[9],the company fitting the tyres  ats lymington  were totally lacking in customer service and i waited 2 hours for the work to be carried out whilst they did other cars which people had dropped off  if you book a time for the work to be carried out they should start the work then  you recommend them 
823,[9],turned up at the garage at appointed time yo be told bkack circles had changed the appointment 
824,"[7, 10]",easy to order  good price  no problems with fitting  all ok
825,"[4, 9]",didn't have the original full set of pilot sport 4s i wanted in stock which is fine  changed order to full set of super sports and set an appointment  this then got delayed until next week because the tires didn't arrive at the garage in time  when i picked my car up from the garage  the rear tires were pilot 4s and the front two were super sports  but the order was changed to a full set of super sports front and back  this is unacceptable on top of the delays and my original order being out of stock  i won't use this service again and won't recommend it 
826,"[4, 9]",when i turned up for my appointment at ats my tyres were not there  so i had to rebook  when i picked up my car  the very 1st time i got into it a warning light was on       all 4 tyyres ranged between 34 and 39 psi  when they should have been at 51  this is wholly unacceptable in my view for a garage to replace all 4 and not bother  last appointment fri should not warrant poor and service       h&s in a car is paramount 
827,[4],happy with tyres  disappointed had to leave car to have tyres replaced  i know the garage was first come first served but i was there before 9 am and told they'd ring me about lunchtime  which they didn't  i also got no paperwork  perhaps dealing with  put me down the work order 
828,"[7, 11]",easy to choose the tires and pick a time and date that is convenient 
829,[4],fitting date changed post booking  very inconvienient  second time this has happened  no evidence of free brake check or free tracking as requested  vehicle left outside fitters unlocked with keys sitting in centre console when asked to lock and retain keys and we would collect with spare  vehicle vibrating at speed so doubt wheels balanced properly  tyres inflated randomly in 4 psi range and incorrect pressure  rubbish really
830,[9],very competitive pricing garage near by to fit the tyres  only complaint was it took nearly 2 hours to fit them even though only one in the garage at the time 
831,[4],bought some tyres  not pleased with them  unable to return them or even get a discount on a replacement set 
832,"[4, 9]",your appointment system is not fit for purpose  i booked wed am but you offered thurs pm as the earliest appointment  you also stated that i should arrive early as the garage operates a first come first served  wrong  they operate an appointment system  mine was for 15 30hrs which you were informed of but failed to pass on  a reoccurring problem i am led to believe  the garage were excellent and revised their schedule to fit me in earlier  still a 3hr wait  your quotes for tracking and alignment were totally inaccurate  the only positive to come out of this debacle  on the day your tyre price was the cheapest i could find 
833,"[4, 11]",i compared  to motokiki bc was cheaper  by a small amount  in fact the high street price was also close for michelin  but my wife took our car to the garage and she found the reception to be rude and uninviting  the completed tyres had damaged the alloy wheels and the tyre pressures were incorrectly inflated 
834,"[4, 9]",although initially my experience was goodmy invoice could be changed on request without full refund which seemed unreasonable   and the service at ats not good
835,[4],the garage that fitted the tyres were clearly trying to deceive me into extra work which did not need doing  so i would not feel able to trust  
836,[8],kevin at mckinnon tyres was very helpful and done a great job
837,[1],great service  friendly fitters arrived on time  great job 
838,[9],whilst the online system was easy and efficient to use  it transpires that the preferred fitting centre wasn’t available despite being able to book at the time  however good communication via phone sorted another garage out and on arrival at said venue on the agreed day the tires had arrived but no booking was in their system  lucky slots existed for both my vehicles to have there tires changed around the online booking times but the garage staff said this was a routine issue with  bookings 
839,[9],had my first experience booked with   am impressed the fact when i booked in for two tyres but then was unable to drive there to due medical reason  luckily i was able to change it for home mobile service and this was completed on the following next day than the original date it was booked it  the fitter was very polite and professional  definite would use it again and certainly does save £££
840,"[5, 10]",  always have good brands at good prices   never have a problem and they use reliable local garages 
841,"[0, 9]",i thought the online booking system was clear and simple and tyres were good value  my minor gripe was a wait at the garage  i never give 10
842,[9],it was a mess from the get go  the fitting date was messed up three times
843,[4],garage fitting tyre did not open till 11 once arrived there again took 2 hrs 30 mins to fit the run flat tyre 
844,"[3, 11]",because i was very happy with the price and delivery off the tyres and the tyre fitters you recommended brilliant
845,"[3, 4]",good experience just wish  good experience and great prices just wish mobile fitting was still an option
846,"[3, 11]", is an excellent service  the tyre choice is comprehensive  the prices rarely bettered  and the local fitting deals  work competently and efficiently  don't have any doubts about sourcing tyres this way 
847,[9], did nothing wrong  except the fitter  i told them i ws on nights  but the didn't turn up till after 6pm  so there till after 7

901,[9],had to wait another day because tyres hadn't arrived yet
902,[4],although i thought the price would save me a few quid it took 3 attempts  and a week later to deliver my tyres to the fitter  fitters  took a long time to fit tyres  and when my pressure warning system kept warning me to check pressures i found that one tyre was inflated to 35psi and the other to 60psi 
903,[9],rubbish website chasing around and misery  website gives time slots and then sends an email the next day saying to contact them as the garage cannot accept the time  nothing to do with the garage  it’s the awful website giving out misinformation and false promises  you then have to ring around chasing them up non stop  awful experience  one i won’t be having with them again

925,None,a great all round service  easy to book online and pick a time preference  arrived within the time scale that was allocated and promptly changed the tyres whilst the car was on our drive  the technician was friendly  knowledgeable and offered useful practical advice  would definitely use again

934,"[4, 7]",booking was easy but fitting at the nominated garage took way too long at nearly 2 hours for 4 tyres
935,[4],tyres ok but fitting was bad  although the tyres i had fitted were the ones i ordered when i was at the ats station in wrexham to have them fitted i was treated very badly by the staff  i would not advocate using this depot to fit tyres again
936,[10],really well priced and very easy to arrange 
937,[4],"rip off extra cost of 35 for each tyre for valve stem and cap if pressure sensor fitted  rip off   extra cost not mentioned on web site or confirmation email laws tyres  aberdeen charge £35 extra for each tyre with auto tyre presure fitted  i have used  many times in past  and recomend to others never again    other major tyre garages have this as part if standard charge or under five pound  not a good deal for me nothing on website to warn you  please ask before going for a fitting if there is any extra cost or go elsewhere    other websites break this down for you to see  not   slim margin for garage on fitting cost thus looks like a ""surcharge"" added by garage   once they have your car on the ramp    "
938,"[2, 3]",very easy website to use   great choice of tyres at competitive prices  just turn up at your chosen fitters tyres ready and waiting  great service will use again 
939,"[4, 11]","worked out well  ""camper"" tyres for motorhomes are not cheap and looking for the continental vanco version never easy   came in as the cheapest supplier  with a van as high as mine and low emission zone restrictions it's difficult to find somewhere to go and 's list of fitters and the map made this a relatively easy process  it turned out to be the garage i always use for my motorhome and was due to take it for an mot anyway "

1034,"[2, 7]",very competative pricing  a local garage to fit
1035,[4],the centre which was supposed to fit my tyres failed to do so  they gave two reasons  one to do with the difference in tread between the new tyres and the existing ones and they also claimed that they tyres supplied may have been for a bmw x5 rather than a bmw x3 - they would have to check 'the dots' but didn't do so  they claim there is an issue with the  website so that customers with x5s or x3s regularly order the wrong tyres   …… 
1036,[9],the fitting centre didn't fit the tyres - i felt i was fobbed off with excuses  i contacted customer services who were initially helpful but after the first contact haven't given me an update and haven't responded to my follow up e-mails requesting an update

1038,[2],great price and service  i have used  before as they are very competitive and efficient  their website is easy to use and entering your reg no ensures you are presented with the correct tyres  i was able to select a local ats garage and the appointment was for 2 days ahead  buying 2 tyres also gave me a small discount  i'm happy to recommend 
1039,[4],my issue is with your agent who damaged refurbished alloys but refused to accept responsibility despite us providing photo evidence that the wheels were unmarked when the car went in to them  this is not the first time mercia motors have damaged the wheels but will be the last as i will not use them again 
1040,[11],second time i've used   so convenient  no waiting at garages for a slot  just book and turn up  and the tyres i and my son have bought have been better quality and cheaper than going to a high street tyre dealer  5 star rating from us 
1041,[9],i had 4 pre arranged bookings cancelled and nothing by way of an apology from  
1042,"[4, 9]",ordered 2 new tyres  given a date for fitting then message saying they had not been delivered  got a new date and guy turned up to fit them  wrong size of tyre  given new date again and was cancelled the night before the fitting via email  the next day a message from the fitter saying he was there to fit the tyres  good job from the fitter but poor getting them fitted  given £21 back because the tyres which i had been charged for were more expensive than the actual ones which should have been delivered  still waiting for the refund after 7 days
1043,"[3, 4]",just any excuse not to be ripped off by kwikfit  good prices on a lot of brands  i went for  quality choice  and i am not disappointed  much quieter than my old p zeros 
1044,"[4, 8]", as a whole i would recommend but not the garage i had tyres fitted at  both alloy wheels were completely covered in grease  no attempt had been made to clean the grease off

1048,"[4, 11]",exceeded my expectations  having had a look around on-line  i found that  pricing was far easier to understand than the others  rather than sucker you in with a low tyre price then add everything on after they gave a price and stuck with it  i had all 4 tyres done  took advantage of an offer they had on michelin tyres and was pleased with the service  arrived at the fitting partner  tyres there  job done thank you

1052,"[4, 11]",its convenient  i can choose whatever fitting option suits me  the mobile fitter i have used the last two occasions has been excellent  i would only add that maybe a loyalty scheme woulld be a great idea  i have used  for many years now and i'd like to think that you could work your way up to a decent discount at a certain interval  or a waived mobile fitter fee or something  there is such competition now for prices and rewarding loyalty goes a long way  i find the competition things that appear at the end of a sale a faff to be honest  having to log into one thing or another to get 5 free entries on this or another 2 on that  i'd rather go in and buy my tyres and earn something for my loyalty 
1053,[10],great price and slick service with local garage

1119,[9],so it was my first time ordering from you - the website  great  easy to use  purchasing the tyres and selecting the extra for the tracking - great  no issues at all  i bought on the 27th and it was confirmed on the 29th for fitting on the 31st  i was then contacted on the 30th to advise there was a delay in delivering the tyres so they changed the fitting day to friday 2nd august  upon arriving  the order  was for 1 tyre to be fit  not 2  they called through to try and sort this  which took a few attempts but got resolved  i also noticed that on their screen they had the tyres on the 30th  so all in all  a poor first impression  a terrible second impression and possibly a lie/miss-communication for third 
1120,"[4, 11]",good customer service  easy to buy the tyres via the website and select the garage you want them fitted at  on a day and time that suits you  the prices are usually very good too  especially if there’s a sale on or discount code  you can either wait with your vehicle or go off shopping etc  while the tyres are being fitted  took about 20-30 mins for my front two tyres to be fitted  it’s good that they don’t use the wheel nut air guns   instead they hand tighten the wheel nuts first and then manually torque wrench them on at the correct setting 
1121,[9],i booked 4 appts that all showed as available and in each case the appointment was cancelled  this was both disruptive from a practical perspective and also each cancelled appt took 3 working days to refund  there was very little in the way of an apology and certainly not a great customer experience 
1122,[11],good but not great  good: headline price was on a par with other online retailers  good choice of local tyre fitters bad: there was a discount code for 10%  which i entered in the apprioriate box  rushing to place my order an hour before the offer expired  but the 10% discount was never applied  kept thinking it'll show in the next step but it never did 
1123,[9],was messed around quite a lot - times rearranged due to tyres not being delivered  then put back to the original appointment - without cancellung the changed one  will go directly through the garage next time   messed me about too much for the same price as the garage would have given without them 
1124,"[3, 4]",tyres fitted at home  excellent tyres  excellent service  all at no extra cost 
1125,[3],excellent tyres for a good price fitted conveniently 
1126,"[9, 11]",excellent value  allowed change inbtyre after realising error following order  local garage used to fit tyres were good and allowed me to get tyres a day early

1129,[0],great value as always  easy arranged  thanks
1130,[9],considerable confusion over fitting date  i was asked by email to change the day i had booked  which i said i was happy to do  but received no confirmation  i subsequently had to phone cs to ask if it was confirmed  at which point i was given another day   i was then worried about the fitter turning up on the previously agreed day so i contacted the fitter directly to make sure 
1131,"[7, 10]",was straight forward and a good price plus the garage i used gave me good service
1132,[9],you gave me a garage appointment when tyres were not there  they fitted tyres next day  he didn’t check tracking he told me and therefore i doubt very much if he did the other free checks too  therefore i did not rate the service at all and will not be using you again or recommending you either 
1133,[9],tyres did not arrive when said they would and it was really important that i got them on time  so for me as i said at time would never use you again  garage was fine no problems that side of job 
1134,[1],excellent service from start to finish  would highly recommend  with their fitting service included it’s hard to find a better price for tyres  fitting balancing and disposal of old 
1135,"[1, 10]",price and service from ats
1136,[4],good price punctual great fitting service by ats  correct tyres arrived at ats local national chain on time  and fitting was undertaken at the booked time  my mercedes sl500 is particulraly sensative to poor wheel balancing particularly getting the inside of the rim balanced agsinst the outside  ats did this perfectly  they were also able to undertake 4 wheel alignment at 1/2 the price of my local small specialist mercedes garage   the price was as good as any of the other online supplers  as i often find y rated dunlops were cheaper than w rated tyres  perfectly legal to fitted higher rated tyres than minimum requirement  these were also mo fitment tyres
1137,[9],great prices appalling organisational skills would not use again  i needed tires fitted at the weekend as mine were severely worn according to my mot and i had a number of journeys to make with some pretty appalling weather forecaster  a friend suggested i check out   the prices looked great and a good range of local garages  so i went ahead and placed an order  the following day  i received an email from them saying they couldn't book me in on the saturday at my chosen garage and the next available slot was the following monday  i replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as i needed them fitted that weekend  about an hour later i received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now wednesday  i asked for my money to be refunded and figured i would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it  heard nothing back and no refund which meant i couldn't book in at the local garage instead  followed up on the monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back  i ended up having to send an email to a different department  along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded  no apology for the inconvenience or anything like that and then a follow up email asking me to review my conversation with someone i had never spoken with  i presume all the good reviews on here are people who haven't had an issue and everything has gone smoothly and all power to them  just beware that if something does go wrong with your order it seems you're stuffed trying to sort it out 
1138,[9],i had to cancel my first order because of mixed tyres  i reordered new tyres and had same booking date and time but when i arrived at garage the job was not on their system as the call handler at your company neglected to put the job through to collinson’s so i had wasted a days holiday from work for no reason  i was not even offered an explanation as to the reason for the mess up  i thought i might have been offered some kind of remuneration as i had lost a days holiday from work due to  foul up 
1139,"[1, 11]",excellent web page  ease of use  i got the right tyres at the right price i had these tyres fitted at ats ilkeston and the fitter brian was exceptional with a great customer service thank you

1153,[9],i had a bit of hassle initially trying to get it booked  not helped by the person dealing with it not reading the information correctly
1154,"[7, 10]",the buying experience was good but the garage experience was not
1155,"[4, 9]",i have used you in the past and had excellent service  the past company i had the tyres fitted at were excellent  but no longer one of your options for fitting now  i chose your premium fitter in basingstoke  formula one auto - and they were awful  their customer service was non existent  i phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked  they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed  but i probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do  with this i sent my husband to have the tyres fitted  so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed  they took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres  way longer than it should have for 4 tyres  i phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge  which  because i know about cars i knew to be rubbish  he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me  which i would get in a week  i then discovered the next day when i took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi  after 10 days i phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived  i was promised a call back  which never came  a week later i chased again  again promised a call back and again did not hear from them  a few days later i called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back  but still did not call  a few days later i eventually got the cheque refund through  the tyres themselves are good  but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars  thankfully although my husband doesn't i do  it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people  so for that reason whilst i may still recommend  for tyres i would be very  very  very careful about who fits mine in the future and advise anyone else to be too

1217,[11],didnt get tyres i was expecting  these were cheap and easy to book for fitting but i was disappointed to discover that  isn’t a brand and that they just give you whatever budget tyre they have in stock  i liked the ratings on the tyre advertised but these didn’t match with what i got  this matters to me when it comes to buying tyres so i probably won’t use  again

1310,[3],good premium tyres at a good price
1311,[4], are brilliant  great vfm however  the garage that i used wasn't great at all  i am a disabled driver  there was no seat area available  so i stood around or sat on a wall of a neighbouring property  the task took 1 25hrs to replace 2 tyres  i don't think that's very good  do you 
1312,[7],it was quick and easy to sort online out of normal working hours to allow fitting at a suitable time  the fitting was local and service there was much better than when i have been as a customer not having used  
1313,"[3, 11]",cuts down the time looking at various retailers  tyres quoted for are a good quality  not major brands at an excellent price  low road noise and good in the wet and all 4 were fitted within 40 minutes of the time quoted  excellent service
1314,[9],fitting cancelled twice the night before as tyres out of stock  no alternative suggested there was poor communication when i called  ie was told they would call back if new fitting time was available - didn’t hear back 🙈1 lady did give me £20 refund and was very efficient & eventually sorted the delivery of my tyres 
1315,[9],would have been 10 but we were let down ay 5 15pm the afternoon before the fit by an email cancelling the fit because the tyres had not arrived at the fitting centre  i telephone  at 8 45am the next day and a very helpful lady telephoned the fitting centre and rang me back to say they had now arrived and to head up there  waited 90 minutes before they began fitting and was there two and a half hours  
1316,"[4, 7]",the process of ordering was fine but the end result of over forcing extra sales and over charging at the garage was disappointing 
1317,[9],was easy to order but even though i was able order tyres for different vehicles i wasn't able to book 2 vehicles in to have them fitted  fortunately i knew the garage owner and her was able to sort it out for me  otherwise there would have been a lot of confusion  also tyres were delivered on different days so wasn't able to get tyres both cars on the same day

1334,[4],everything the present day consumer expects  swift  painless and economic  everything the present day consumer asks for  i chose my local ats garage for location rather than anything else  but that was also a great experience  my tyres were removed  shifted to the rear and new tyres fitted within about 40 minutes  which included completing paperwork  having a coffee  checking my emails and chatting to the knowledgable and really friendly and professional service advisors  a genuine top drawer experience  and of course the price and choice of tyres was the key to my decision for choosing

1364,[9],everything with service from  was ok but my initial booking was cancelled at my preferred garage  rearranged booking was ok but after being informed that my original garage was unavailable i went back into  and the garage was still available for selection on the morning of my booking  if a garage is unavailable surely it shouldn’t be there for selection  my rearranged appointment was ok for me but wouldn’t necessarily be ok for someone else
1365,[11],why do it any other way  you get to chose the tires and pick what garage you want at a time that suits you  the only time this service doesn't work is if you need to replace a tire due to a puncture or damage  a great service and very easy and if you have any issues communication from  is easy  even the garages don't mind you using them  thanks for the service

1387,[2],agreat site and reliable trades peope
1388,[9],i looked at the  website and it seemed ideal - very competitive price   very local fitting and appeared that i could get my tyre replaced very quickly i'd got a puncture on saturday night so on monday i tried to ge ta new tyre - the  website said first available date wednesday -i thought this was reasonable as i have had difficulty sourcing tyres before - i picked a very local garage and it came up with virtually every time slot available - i picked one and received an email with booking reference etc     i assumed this meant it was booked the next day i received an email and text saying to contact  urgently - which i did - i was told i couldn't have the appointment i had booked and on asking for an alternative appointment that day i was told there were none available - they were fully booked  i asked why i had received an email and was told that isn't a confirmation i was then told i could have an appointment on thurs at any time - i opted for 11:00am although i could have done any time    i was contacted about 10mins later to be told there were no appointments for the whole of thursday    why offer me any time iwanted if i wasn't able to get any appointment   by this time i just wished i'd never paid for the tyre and had tried elsewhere - i was then told i could have any time friday   i said i was working on friday and wouldn't be able to ge tto the garage until 15:30    they shut at 16 00     but i was told i could have that time i arrived at the garage early and they said they could do my tyre now   but when they went to look they said they didn't think the tyre had come as there was nothing in my name   as i was about to explode they said they had a tyre not in my name that they could fit now after explaining my frustrating experience to the guy in the garage he said if i'd called them directly on monday - they could have done it that afternoon        although they probably couldn't compete with the price - he looked for me and it would have cost £6 more    i probably would have paid £40 more   not because i wanted to but for the convenience and lack of stress i had to endure dealing with  if in the beginning i'd been told i couldn't have it done until friday i would have been frustrated but it would have been my choice wether i continued with the purchase or went elsewhere - but to be mucked about and having to reschedule appointments etc    i definitely will not be using them again or be recommending them to anyone else
1389,"[6, 9]",excellent service  i needed to change the fitting date and a quick call and it was all sorted and confirmed with an email  fitting was done on time  price was competitive  thank you  will definitely use you again and have recommended to friend at work

1396,[9],appointment booking for a saturday showed as available  when the garage isn’t open on saturday  causing a weeks delay and be sent to a different garage 
1397,[11],i was able to purchase the tyres i wanted at a very reasonable price  i then loved that i could book a garage near to me to fit them where i could read previous customer feedback to ensure i choose the best and they were great

1402,[9],good price and the service worked dont call the company you will be robbed  good price and the service worked  however the online credit card transaction defaulted after my card was approved which meant i had to call  on their customer service number  i did not realise that this was a premium number and although i was eventually connected we easily resolved payment  following the call i received a message from my mobile phone provider telling me that the call cost over £30   ironically the call was a wi-fi call so ordinarily would not cost anything thing  all of my savings were absorbed by this phone call  i am very unhappy and feel that i have been duped 
1403,"[9, 10]",price was good but i arrived at the garage and the tyres were not there   i had to do all of the chasing and create the solution   no apology from

1405,[9],very easy to book and compare tyres  no problems until my time slot was changed  when i got to the fitting centre they were not made aware of my booking including the type of tyres booked and vehicle or my appointment time however they were brilliant and able to fit me it anyway
1406,"[1, 4]",while the fitting team damaged my car  i appreciate that they are nothing to do with  and the support you gave me afterwards was fantastic  great customer service
1407,[9],eventually got 3td choice tyres due ordering specific tyres and then twice being told yo haven't got them  first delivery to garage got lost

1409,"[1, 4]",great service  great staff but app only allows am/pm  1hour to fit 2 tyres was a little on the long side
1410,"[4, 9]",cornish holiday not spoiled by my damaged tyre  had a problem with a tyre splitting along the tread so even though i was on holiday i felt it needed to be changed  used  because the fitting company was closest to my holiday address  prices were very good and they offered a discount for 2 tyres so went for that  i checked that the fitter had received the tyres before i drove over  communications were excellent  ordering was really easy  and the tyres were delivered in good time  garage provided a tyre fitting report showing all the job details  they also provided me with a brake inspection report  nothing to find fault with 
1411,[7],easy process  easy to ordergood pricesall went easy at garagewould recommend
1412,"[4, 9]",frankly all a bit of a muddle  lots of emails and texts confirming this that and the other  half of which was relating to things that had changed  phone calls with the fitters who initially said they knew nothing of the appointment  then a changed appointment  then two appointments the same day but six hours apart; all a bit of a pickle  thankfully only one appointment was required to fit all four tyres  but only the inner part of the valves were changed because the outers were out of stock which i only found out about when i went back to complain about the balancing not being correct  everyone involved was very nice  the whole experience was just a muddle and could have been so much better  left feeling quite disappointed and messed around by the whole experience 
1413,"[0, 9]",great value  easy to use     there was an unavoidable problem on sourcing the tyres so had to change appointment     the way  handled this was very efficient and effective    fitting service organised by  was excellent - convenient  very modern facility
1414,[11],first time using  and can honestly say it was an easy way to say a few pounds on my new michelin ps4's tyres for my bmw m140i i saved £50 by ordering from here and still had them fitted next day by a local garage 
1415,"[3, 5]",good service  fitting was at the same location that i have normally used direct

1418,"[4, 7, 9]",excellent customer service  needed 5 new tyres for my car  luckily on the day i ordered there was a 10% discount  saved me £110  later there was a problem with the fitting time  customer services re-arranged the time seamlessly and kept me informed through the whole process the garage fitted the tyres without a problem 
1419,"[4, 9]",the guy who changed the tires was spot on  the issue that i had was that i booked an am time slot for this and the engineer didn't arrive until 3pm  i wasn't even advised that he was running late 
1420,[4],at your expense and loss  i buy the best of the best after researching what i’m buying  so i’m confident in what i’m paying for  i got two perelli grade a tyres from here and fitting arranged a ford custom 2015 high spec a free winter check was offered i accepted  a week after my tyre fitting and winter check my van over heats  turned out a mechanic left the expansion tank cap off resulting in a catastrophic engine failure three weeks on i’m still trying to get this company to get my van a detailed diagnosis let alone to fix the problem  was offered to take it back to the tyre garage that create this problem to look at but they are not specialists in engine management let alone poor competence to do a winter check 
1421,[8],quick and efficient  i chose the pilot sport 4 tyres for my audi s3  the fitter cost £6 to come or my house which is absolutely nothing  excellent service i will be using  again  so much cheaper than garages 
1422,[9],the buying experience was good however the morning appointment for the tyre fitting that i specified was not honoured  i dropped my vehicle off at protyre  carterton just after opening and it was not ready to collect until after two o clock  all that was provided by protyre were excuses  not a good experience and significantly delayed my plans for the afternoon 
1423,[9],last minute change  had a booking that was changed last minute  the day before the tyre fitting was due complained about this as cause huge disruption to the following day and had a knock on effect as had to rebook in a reschedule work diary tyres now sorted however very slow responses from the customer care team and still don’t know if they have fully resolved the issue 
1424,"[6, 9]",recommended to use   price was competitive  problem with delivery to chosen garage due to access caused a delay but refunded £20 as a consequence without asking for any compensation  tyres fitted by steve’s autos  lancing  good man  good job  very efficient and polite  would definitely use him again 
1425,[9],whilst price is good the last 2 orders and fitments have been delayed and rebooked due to the tyres not arriving in time  fortunately this wasnt an a issue but might have been if booked prior to a holiday or mot test 
1426,[3],excellent in every respect  excellent choices with good descriptions  user reviews and prices  delivered as stated at time of ordering and great choice of fitting centres highly recommended 
1427,[9],i ordered 2 tyres to be delivered to ats llanelli  after half an hour of dropping my car in the garage i received a phone call from ats notifying ma that only 1 tyre had been delivered and that was the wrong tyre 
1428,"[9, 10]",quick and easy service to use  good variety of selected garages to choose from  there was a delay in my tyre delivery; this was communicated to me effectively and rescheduled with no issues  the service from the selected garage was good and i saved money using  
1429,[9],could not get through to an agent by phone at all  but i was able to manage the fitting time by e-mail
1430,[6],very impressed with the prices and the service  cant be faulted  well done; keep it up  will definitely buy from you again 
1431,[9],the worst communication  to say i had a terrible customer experience is and understatement  to start off this terrible experience i had booked an am fitting and there was no sign of the driver by 13:00 so i attempted to call  and was on hold for over 25 minutes  i didnt have anymore time to spend on the phone so i tried to send them and email asking whether or not the driver was going to turn up at all forgetting the am fitting like i had booked   not only did i not receive an email back with any information on the drivers where-abouts  i still haven't had an email back from them regarding the whole situation or apology 
1432,"[1, 3]",great  polite service at garage and great price for tyres 
1433,[10],good price and service
1434,[4],purchasing tyres was easy  getting them fitted was a complete nightmare - 14/08  arrived at 7 45am for an 8am fitting  i left the garage at 11am  i complained at the timeabout the time it took took replace the 4 tyres  - 15/08  started vehicle at 7 30am to drive to work  tyre pressure warning light came on so checked tyres  rear driver side tyre low as tyre was leaking air  also noticed the tyre fitters had damaged wheels  had to drive to the fitters to sort out air leak and complained about fresh damage to wheels  took abou half for them to sort wheels and decided i would complain in writing rather than confront the fitters as at the time i was and am fuming  - 15/08  mot booked in with bmw  car passed mot  however i was advised that the front brake pad warning wire was hanging  had to book car in again on the 18/08 to be rectified 19/08  bmw checked the front brake pad warning wire  brake pads and discs replaced by bmw in march and was advised by bmw that the front brake pad warning compartment was cracked and the wire left hanging when the tyres were changed im not one to complain  however all the above are unacceptable i will be pursuing this      
1435,[4],very good prices and fitted at local garage  after my first journey i had a flat tyre  took vehicle back to fitter who said puncture that cannot be repaired  after much mumbling to myself rang  to order another tyre and was told i was covered by lifetime guarantee on that tyre and replaced foc  i was surprised and delighted and will definitely use again and recommend

1442,[11],quite good but others are occasionally cheaper
1443,[9],i ordered my tyre and arranged a fitting date monday 29 july i them got an email from you telling that my tyre has been delayed and not available until tuesday 6th august i contacted the garage that was fitting the tyre to cancel my appointment only to be told they had the tyre delivered and could be fitted i have since had several emails from you to make a new time for fitting when it has already been done

1450,"[6, 7]",i have used  before and been very happy but this time the tyres were not delivered on time
1451,[9],staff were helpful a d polite but first selection turned out not to be available after being told it was  offered alternative but never arrived at garage  lost  that tyre was then not available so onto third choice which were fitted ok 
1452,[9],a bit of a mixed bag of goodbadgreat  a bit of a mixed bag in terms of overall experience i'm afraid  so lower rating than i anticipated  finding and paying for the tires online  including the actual price for high grade michelins  was all very good   things just fell apart after choosing the deliver and fit option to a local  garage  using the online booking too was a doddle but within 24hrs i had an email saying the time was no longer any good as the garage was fully booked  then the customer service for alternative provision was basically picked for me from a few days/times i offered   the worst part however was taking time of work to visit the garage only to be told 'they don't book tire fitting at their garage' and basically being told to wait in line for 45 mins behind the drive-in customers   bit pointless having a booking system and they fully blamed  for offering something online that well basically  wasn't offered in the real world  i have to say on the garage's part though they were excellent when i returned after about 40 mins and did the 2x tires very quickly and capably  so the eventual service was great  my tip then: ring the garage even if you book tires online with bc else you are wasting your time potentially 
1453,[3],excellent price and service from allocated dealer 
1454,[7],tyres turned up on time and as described 
1455,[4],great prices & customer service  recommend both  and d&r motors  left me lockable wheel nuts at garage  and  immediately contacted me to let me know  would use again

1458,[7],easy to place order  and arrange fitting
1459,[9],used  twice  never again  was supposed to be fitted on wednesday got an email at 6:30pm tuesday saying there was an issue and could not fit on wednesday  rang the garage who said two tyres were delivered they asked where the others were and was told that  only ordered two instead of four  had to rearrange the rest of my week because of this 
1460,[9],initial tyre order was lost in the post on way to the fitting garage  i was informed the day before by email and text that there was a change to my order  no indication of what had changed  i read the new email and missed the date change wasted my time by going to the garage  who didn't have the tyres when i noticed the date change  i would recommend that they update the messages to state what has changed i was called later in the afternoon  as there was no more stock of the tyres i had purchased and was offered a free upgrade to better tyres   the second visit and fitting went without any issues good customer service but i've removed one star just because of the issues faced  and the fact they need to let you know what has changed 
1461,[9],not a great experience with  com on this occasion   firstly the cancelled my original appointment at 3pm on the day before i was due to get my tyres fitted   they took upon themselves to move my appointment on 2 days after the original appointment   when i eventually got there after rearranging my schedule the person at the garage informed me that they had the tyres but my appointment had been cancelled and that i had to phone to confirm so they would get paid  the only reason they have 2 stars instead of one was that the garage i went to we really helpful  
1462,[9], only delivered three tyres to the garage instead of four for the following day fitting which had to be cancelled  an mot was also arranged to coincide with the fitting which had to be cancelled and rearranged  unusually  as my wife is severely disabled and requires constant care  arrangements were made for her to be looked after at the day centre in kirriemuir on the first date given  consequently  similar arrangements had to be made on the actual day of the fitting  so in my case the late cancelation caused considerable problems 
1463,[9],i had the garage all booked  tyres didn't arrive so had to rearrange the following week  then get told the garage couldn't fit me in for another 3 weeks  so had to go to a different garage further away 
1464,[10],good tyre section easy to arrange a service garage with a good selection of slots to have the tyres changed at competitive prices

1472,"[3, 11]",good prices but fitting garage didn't want to know when they knew the tyres were from yourselves
1473,[9],poor customer service  well having used  before i opted to purchase some fully fitted tyres from them got the confirmation email and booking for fitting  so i took half day off work to allow  very late email arrives saying delay and so booking moved a day forward  so another half day booked and what another late email saying can’t actually get hold of tyres  i rang their customer services who had no sympathy at all for 2 half days being booked and they could offer me cheaper tyres at the same price of which i refused  i explained that my chosen tyres were still on sale on their website but for some reason were almost £20 more for each tyre  could this be the reason  who knows  anyway i had to opt for different tyres to be fitted which meant another delay and more time off work  also the tyres were cheaper and a refund is pending but nothing yet so i’ll have to contact them again 🙁
1474,"[6, 11]",im a happy repeat customer  i'm a repeat customer for great service and excellent value  the independent garage at bolney grange near haywards heath who fitted my first set of  tyres years ago  have been my garage for a number of years now   website is the first place i look for tyres for my bmw z4 
1475,[9],tyre not available on first date booked had to rebook
1476,[9],disappointing for what use to be a great company  i have used  for 2 years  slowly but surely the service has got poorer and poorer  no response from email queries  dates for fitting are promised and then cancelled  having finally decided to use ats tyres direct  who were actually cheaper  my refund has still not be received after two weeks  the work was subcontracted through ats anyway  a real shame for what use to be a great business

1485,"[1, 4]",exceptional service  i bought a rear tyre for my mondeo  when i went for fitting it turned out that i'd chosen the wrong speed rating  i called  expecting the worst  to my complete surprise and  dare i say  joy they arranged for this to be picked up and the correct one sent out  i will not hesitate to use  again  a great price  great service and nice people to boot  thank you
1486,"[4, 9]",first time i have used  and never again  first they delivered one 18 inch & one 19 inch tyre instead of two 18's once this had been sorted out i went to get the tyres fitted and was appalled by the shabby condition of the tyres; they looked grey and old  not at all how new tyres normally look  not surprising when i inspected the 'dot date' and it was 4517  who told me that they have many different suppliers and do not check the age of the tyres they could re-order but no guarantee that the replacements would be any newer  not at all happy and requested a refund which they say they will do

1534,[9],the tyres themselves were good but  told me a specific time and when i went to the garage they’d received the tyres but not been told who for or when  they said they couldn’t fit me in but eventually after an hour and half they did  it’s possible that it was the garages fault but they did say this has happened before  the price was good and they were put on but the communication wasn’t fantastic and i had a long wait despite being told a time- was it  or the garages fault   i’d use them again despite the mixup for the price 
1535,"[7, 10]",very good but    seem to provide an excellent service at a good price and easy to order online etc  the twice i have used them  i have ended up at the same garage for fitting  and there was a little bit of attitude because we didn't book direct with the garage  otherwise all good

1612,[9],price was good but arranging fitting i had to sort it out myself with the garage as date i booked online was not available and my alternative date that was arranged with your call handler it seems that she did not confirmed it with the garage so it was not booked by them

1618,"[4, 11]",the company that fitted the tyres chipped the paint on the inside of every wheel 
1619,"[4, 9]",the fitting experience was poor  i had to go back twice  firstly for the balancing and then because one of the tyres kept deflating  the deflating issue had to then be rectified by another garage at my cost as i had by then lost confidence in the fitting garage to rectify it 
1620,[9],: 1) failed to keep original booking date 2) failed to show up for rearranged date and time 3) failed to address issue   just offered new appointment with another centre 4) failed to consider that original booking was for mobile fitting and alternative centre did not offer this

1625,[9],ordered on-line and gave details of my standard vehicle  arrived for mid-morning appointment to be told that none of the equipment was capable of lifting it  the staff were critical of their boss who had supplied them with innapropriate lifting equipment which they don't use  having already paid for the tyres + fitting i had no choice but to load up the 4 tyres and drive 3 junctions down the motorway to another affiliated garage and have them fitted that afternoon   wasted my day there's no point being able to order on-line if the the computer does'nt recognise and decline unsuitable vehicles at the point of purchase  if in doubt i suggest you contact your local  prior to ordering on-line to save a wasted journey  i was offered 10% discount on a future purchase which did'nt thrill me much i hope you have the opportunity to read this mr  cole 
1626,[9],tyre order was delayed which was a bit frustrating but was rescheduled  i called the garage fitting the tyre for me and managed to get in the following day so all good great prices and customer service 
1627,[9],disappointing but got there in the end  tyre not delivered on selected date  delivered to the garage on the third appointment  emailed  twice with no response  yes the tyre was slightly cheaper  but would you rather not just pay £10 or so more  and get one fitted the same day

1649,[9],found your service and that of ats very good and was satisfied with the work done  had initial problems with booking times as time i selected was found to be not available  however  alternative availability was satisfactory  only problem was that ats were not able to carry out the free alignment checks after fitting the tyres as i believes someone had damaged their equipment  i have made alternative arreangements for this thanks for your service

1651,[4],upon arrival phil behind counter was very customer friendly and and said take a seat and i will get car in workshop
1652,"[1, 2]",great prices and service  great prices  easy site to use  in conjunction with their fitting partners  everything once again went without a hitch  i'd recommend them 
1653,[4],after getting the tyres fitted they were filthy dirty and i had black marks all over my alloys that took me ages to scrub off
1654,[9], did not communicate with the service center correctly  re booked to an annoying time
1655,[4],when i turned up i could see the two guys working were completely rushed off their feet and were a little behind as their equipment had failed  i spoke to tony and considering it seemed quite a stressful time he remained really friendly  upbeat and willing to help  it took a little longer than an hour to change my two front tyres but as they were working on other cars and short staffed it was completely understandable  when i returned a week later to have the torque checked the same two employees were in the middle of changing the tyres on two other cars  they came right over and both quickly checked my tyres  i was thinking i’d be waiting around but i was only there a few minutes  they gave fantastic service and had a great attitude 
1656,"[4, 7]",purchased online  convenient date given  local garage gave excellent service  whole experience fantastic  will definitely buy again through   such an easy process  the tyres i bought had great reviews and have proven themselves; i could feel the difference driving instantly  thanks

1658,"[5, 11]",faultless experience from start to finish  very please with the fitting service too by wellingborough tyres  it goes without saying i was also happy with the price quoted and rhe discount code offered 
1659,[9],no customer service phone number  and customer service only work office hours  they sent me the wrong tyres and it took three emails and four days to get a response from them 
1660,"[6, 7]",booking process was quick and easy with confirmation from the garage  service was first class  so much so i used cargill's autos for my mot the next week  i will certainly use  again 
1661,[10],good price and very good service  not one problem in the whole booking and operation
1662,[10],reasonable priced and always good service from my local fitters 
1663,[4],good fast response and tyres delivered on time  however partner garage fitting i would only rate at 2 star  1  fitter was not going to clean rims to ensure airtight tyre seating till i suggested it  wheel nuts were put back with air gun but checked after with torque wrench which begs question what torque was put on by air gun    i have since loosened and re-torqued the nuts    i gave the torque settings wheel nuts were done up in a circular way i e  1  2  3  4 instead of opposites i e  1  3  4  2    basic knowledge lacking which does not give confidence for any other action that may have been required free tracking check     he did not make sure rack was centralised    good job i did  garage does not have castor/camber checking equipment    surely a must in these days of bad potholes to check suspension alignment for new tyres perhaps it was unfortunate the senior was busy with a rep at the time 
1664,[9],5* despite a hiccup  i got an email from  at 5 15pm to say the next morning's fitting had to be cancelled because the tyres had not been confirmed as 'arrived' by the fitting centre  i phoned customer services at 8 45 the next morning and the lady was excellent in dealing with the matter  she said she would call the fitting centre immediately to see if they had now arrived and call me back  10 minutes later she called back to say they were there and all was well  this was not  problem and i understand and applaud their procedure of checking tyres ordered have arrived to prevent a customer showing up at the fitting centre when the tyres aren't there

1676,[4],the service was exceptional  i ordered the wrong tyres and called the call centre who correct the mistake at no charge and delivered and fitted the tyres as planned

1685,[11],first time using   had a 10% flash sale which made the the cheapest for the tyres i needed  simply paid online and had them fitted by appointment using one of their partners nearby  process simple and efficient  will be first point of call in future

1714,[11],they are so easy to use  you get to choose which tyres at the cost you can afford with reviews on all the tyres great 👍
1715,[9],easy to book online  arrived and seen immediately  arrived to return in 30-45 mins once tyre done  tesco  greg’s and costa in close walking distance  received a phone call after 45 mins to say the tyres were changed  good fast service 
1716,[9],there was a bit of a wobble over the agreed time of the appointment
1717,[9],waste of time and effort  total waste of time and effort  given days until the arranged appointment for fitting  delivered the car today to the selected garage and they haven't arrived  this was despite the text this morning to confirm my appointment  it was extremely important they were fitted today before needing the vehicle for collecting a caravan tomorrow  on hold to the non existent customer services department now for over 15 mins  pathetic wont use again and if you value your time i would advise you not to do so either 
1718,[4],awful experience  purchased 4x brand new tyres to find one has a large bulge in the side wall  this is an extremely dangerous issue and its been 4 days since i reported it and had practically no response  just been asked to take a survey as to what's wrong  nobody has been in contact and considering the potential danger i face the customer care from  is non existent  i will never use this service again 
1719,"[3, 8]",everything went to plan  tyres were at the fitting shop on time excellent service from express tyre service 
1720,[9],poor service  had car booked in for a am appointment on the 23/07/19arrived at garage only to be told two of the tyres were not there luckily i was in the position too leave the car there for the day but garage couldn't guarantee that the tyres would be there on that day  tried contacting  with no joy so basically paid for tyres and fitting and was left to sort out myself  i should have been advised the tyres weren't there i emailed phoned ect and no reply had to leave my car for the full day on the hope the tyres were delivered at some point the tyres were fitted and had to leave work early to collect car can't fault the garage at all but  customer service was shocking and even now on the 1/08/19 have not had any correspondence from them apart from a email asking to review the service this experience would make me think twice about ordering tyres from here again 
1721,"[4, 11]",could not be happier with the service and price  a small independent tyre fitter  really friendly and cheaper than the big name chains  and unlike them  i didn't feel i was getting ripped off and didn't get upsold on other services like tracking this will be my go-to place from now on 
1722,[11],i have to say  booking to selection of my tyres ok but problem arised from fitting company they were low quality a-z no respect at all pro tyre enfield don't choose them total disappointment
1723,"[7, 9]",booking was easy but the service at the centre on the day was disappointing
1724,"[7, 9]",easy to order  good value  handy location for fitting  only downside is that i missed the money off offer by a couple of days 
1725,"[9, 11]",convenient enough but had to wait 3 extra days for fitting due to not being delivered and then the garage said they could of done me 2 tyres cheaper 😂 but after they fitted them
1726,"[9, 10]",very good service and good price  kept me informed when delivery was delayed for a couple of days 
1727,"[0, 7]",excellent service  ordered what i wanted  then got a prompt email advising me if local garage to get them fitted  very professional and good value for money  very pleased 
1728,"[1, 2]",happy customer  easy to use  reasonably priced and lots of options
1729,"[8, 10]",thank you for the whole experience  great quick service and a very good mechanic team who completed the job in good time 
1730,"[7, 11]",easy to buy  easy to select a local garage  no hassle at the garage - they knew it was a bc order and the tire was already there waiting and it was cheaper than everybody else 
1731,"[4, 11]",new tyres  very pleased with 4 avon tyres at £62 each fitted  system worked exactly as it should and chosen garage was competent  thank you 
1732,"[4, 9]",great job done very well  left my keys with the man behind the desk  waited in customers waiting room  had a cuppa then before you know it car is all done  was meant to have free brake and winter check but couldn't wait but have been told i can get it done any time  just got to ring and make an appointment 
1733,[9],there was a delay in delivering the tyre and i had to change the fitting date directly with the fitting company
1734,[1],great service  quick  reasonable priced
1735,[0],easy to organise  and good value 
1736,[1],excellent service & price 
1737,"[6, 8]",excellent choice and service from   the company that fitted the tyres in povey cross road hookwood were excellent  friendly  helpful and offered first class service  premises were clean & modern  with good facilities  would recommend both them & 
1738,[4],i arrived and had to wait for someone to come to speak to me and when he did i was told that he was busy and that he would not be able to fit my tyres for at least an hour and to come back later  i said that i would go shopping and come back in an hour  he just walked away leaving me standing there and just left me standing there  he didn’t ask for my keys and so i had shout to him and ask what to do with them  when i came back into the waiting room he just pointed to my car to indicate that the car was finished and off i went  so much for the expected brake test that i was offered  not a mention of that 
1739,"[3, 6]",i've used  quite a few timesi'm very pleased with the quality and prices 
1740,[4],sent the wrong tyres to be fitted  when ordering  the web page specifically asks for the make and model of vehicle yet doesn’t distinguish the need for run flats on the particular model   pretty hopeless really 
1741,[9],i was emailed at end of the day before the day my tyres were due to be fitted to tell me they were not at the garage  fortunately i decided to go to the fitters to let them know and they told me they had them and proceeded to fit them  i have had no communication from  since 
1742,[11],without a doubt  the best way to buy a tyre  you don't have to put up with some garage telling a product is the best purely because they have it in stock  its also consistently cheaper then all of my local garages 
1743,[7],easy buying experience prices competitive garage i chose were efficient and professional 
1744,[9],postponed fitting date  no information from your staff  lied to from your staff so they don't lose my sale  staff could not decide when my tyres would arrive and didn't know where they were  gave me two fitting times that were different from my original postponed time  clueless as to what was happening and i had to deal directly with the garage to arrange a fitting date 
1745,[9],i booked an appointment online and when i arrived at the garage he said there was no booking on his computer  he also said he was on his own would fit it in but he had other jobs to do first  so would take up to three hours  i decided to rebook for the following week  inconvenient and cost money to get back there 
1746,[9],first appointment was cancelled as weren’t delivered in time  second appointment  i waited and hour before they told me only one tyre had been delivered  had to be away from the office for a third day to finally get the other tyre fitted  would not recommend 
1747,[11],much cheaper way of buying new premium tyres than direct with the company that fitted them  can't quite work out how they do that but don't really care 
1748,"[4, 8]",when you don't have the budget and need tyres in an emergency  i can't speak highly enough 
1749,[4],tyre fitter marked alloys then i had to return a further two times to rectify the tyre loosing pressure  so damaged wheel and subsequent visits to rectify poor fitting 
1750,[11],first time i tried went through whole process to find tyer was out of stock  then garage i went to was not helpful at all
1751,[4],selected the wrong tyres originally   noticed my mistake and when i called to correct my order it was hassle free 
1752,"[3, 7]",easy to book  time slot and garage of my choice then a great service fitting the tyres 
1753,[10],i really like the fitter service i use and  gives me a decent price 
1754,[7],it was really easy to order my tyres and find a local garage to fit them  
1755,"[4, 9]",i choose 8 because of the staff not because of the way your expect your staff to work under the pressure you put them  i waited 3 hours after my book in time before i was able to leave the tyre area  having to pass on a airport run to one of my competitors in the chauffeur business 
1756,"[2, 10]",website easy to use good price lifetime warranty with my tyres plus local fitting services near me good communication from  
1757,[2],will use again  really easy to use and competitive pricing
1758,[9],the staff where friendly and helpful in phone  but the problems where with the order of tyres i had done 2 or 3 days later got email saying can't get them so advised on another similar type thought not a problem till i got to garage and garage had recieved my original order and 2 further sets of tyres which also had to change booking day as apparently first set weren't in but garage said they recieved them on the day  complete mix up 
1759,[1],great service   ats were excellent
1760,[10],good price and quick fitting
1761,[3],great website and service from the fitting centre  plus a fantastic price    what more can i say

1766,[9],customer service received has been shocking  complaint raised over a week ago and still no solution to the problem  takes around 2 days to get a response  every email i have received has been from a different person 
1767,"[4, 9]",the garage that i chose to fit my tyres spent more time going round my car looking for other work they could carry out rather than get on with fits two front tyres and do the tracking  2 hrs 20 mins for this to be carried out  i will be having tyres off the shelf in future and fitted at just tyres  the name speaks for its self 
1768,"[7, 11]",very easy process and cheaper than others
1769,"[7, 8]",highly recommend  excellent  great price and timed slot for fitting worked perfectly at a garage just up the road from me       what more do you need  thanks for a great service 😊

1777,[10],very efficient service  good price for tyres
1778,[9], failed to get my tyres to my selected garages not once but twice   and kept asking me how i wanted to proceed  obviously just deliver the tyres to the garage  the same thing happened the last time i ordered tyres from  but i let it go  i thought it might have been a one off but the exact same thing happen this time   just days of replying to emails and arranging fitting days over the phone with my garage no thanks
1779,[11],2 out 2  i have used  twice and i have been very content with the service  quality tyres supplied to local garages and keeping local independent companies in business 
1780,[7],internet experience good  booking slot not as organised as should be
1781,[9],after being given a fitting date when the order was placed i then received an email saying that it would be pushed out by an additional 2 days due to unforeseen problems  this email was sent after closing hours so i couldn't make contact to try and resolve the issue sooner  i then had to call back then next day numerous times to find a solution  it turned out that it was simply because the arrival of the tyres hadn't been confirmed with the fitting centre  turns out tyres were there after all and they could be fitted on the requested day but by this point not until lunchtime and i'd had to take time off work to get this sorted and done 
1782,"[4, 9]",1 of the tire fitted has a slow puncture 
1783,"[4, 9]",the guy who greated me basically just grunted at me  they did not replace my spare tyre and i had to go back to collect it  there was no apology for the mistake or for me having to take more time out from work to collect the tyre  one of my tyres then kept deflating and i once again had to go back to get this rectified  they guys on my 3rd visit were very nice but explained that the rim had not been prepared/ cleaned properly on the first fit nor was there enough sealant which is what caused the leak  again no apology or any offer of recompense for my time or expence in 2 addition visits which were at  fault
1784,"[4, 9]",your auto system ordered the wrong tyres for my car  result my repair could not be done  the second appointment was supposed to happen between 8 30 and 12 but the fitter had an all day booking so arrived around 2pm my car was off the road for 6 extra days because of your error and much time was wasted  true you did not charge me the difference in price on the right tyre but you caused me far more trouble than the £15 discount 
1785,"[4, 9]",had 2 tyres fitted was not told at the time we would have to go to ford dealers after fitting to have the tyre valves reset 
1786,"[4, 7]",no issue with online process  no issue with online selection and pre-purchase of tyres  or booking 4wheel alignment tyre fitting centre damaged steering wheel during alignment ; being sorted out but currently still unresolved
1787,[9],i was told the night before that the tyres hadn't arrived so could be fitted on the tuesday and earliest would be thursday  i emailed to ask why and yes that would be ok  still had no response      my wife then has a phone call mid day tuesday so say the tyres were there ready to be fitted  when fitting was taking place all the tyre fitters did was swear  not great if children were present 
1788,[2],great selection of tyres to mmet your budget requirements
1789,[2],web site easy to use  price good  one snag was that my booking was not initially seen by the dealer who seemingly had to manually transfer the booking for his staff to see it  this hadn't been done till after i arrived  /dealer systems not integrated  however all went well after that  thanks

2264,[9],not very impressed with  wont use again  not very impressed with   won't be using them again  to be fair the mobile fitter  was the main problem  was lied to twice that they would-be fitted in the morning  then i got the usual we don't have the tyres yet phone call rubbish called  who promised that he did have the tyres and they would be done in the am slot but of course  he never showed in the morning called  many times to complain  emails sent and an automatic call back left     never heard from them again poor customer service  unreliable fitter 2 days on since their response they never did contact me again   all talk no action 
2265,[9],the garage could not honour the booking time  why does your website offer such slots if they don’t exist  the garage had my car all day as a result 
2266,"[0, 9]",you did everything you said you would tyres were good value appointment was on time friendly service couldn't ask for more
2267,[4],bunch of money grabbers  i recently parked outside my local waste disposal tip  only to get an immediate and fast puncture on my front nearside wheel on the sidewall  knowing full well i couldn't get a repair to a sidewall puncture i accepted and mentally took on an unexpected and very expensive replacement tyre thru topcashback co uk and found   i've just heard this morning that  has rejected my claim despite my clicking thru topcashback and despite my paying full price 
2268,[7],i just find the whole process very easy to do  i can get very good priced tyres  then just have them delivered to my nearest  fitting service centre   book a slot  then 30 minutes & they are done & on my car  what’s not to like 😊
2269,"[3, 4, 9]",excellent service eventually as could not be fitted in at my choice of fitter  had to pay a bit extra to move tyres round car but this was not a problem
2270,[11],because  provides a wider choice of tyres than the local atseuromaster and yet i can still have these tyres supplied by  fitted by my local atseuromaster  a win win situation 
2271,[4],really friendly and trustworthy service  i ordered the wrong tyre but  notified me of this and helped me change it  then the tyre was not needed as the garage could repair the puncture   collected the tyre and refunded me without any fuss 
2272,"[4, 6]",fantastic  quick no big sales chat  customer service are amazing  no issues they just sort it  i have used a few times now
2273,[1],the cost of the tyres is very competative however the customer service is excellent  i had an issue and the way your customer service dept dealt with it was exceptional  thank you
2274,"[7, 9]",confusion as to status of order - duplicated order need to be sorted out but
2275,[1],excellent service and communication with us as customers 
2276,[1],very nice customer service😊
2277,"[4, 9]",initial purchasing experience was fine  there was an issue with the fitting date  but i communicated with rajesh and then bihan to get a different date agreed  that was all fine however once the fitter had completed everything and was about to leave  he told me that he couldn't balance the tyres as he didn't have the necessary fitment for my wheels  i contacted  customer service by email to try and resolve this but didn't get a reply  meaning i had to take my car to a separate service centre and pay an additional £38 to get the four wheels balance  my overall impression is that  are good to communicate with  prior to the sale  but follow up service  at least in my case  was non existent 
2278,[9],good price and staff at ats were great but  did not inform me that ats couldn't meet the slotted time of 1000 and had booked me in for 1400 instead  poor communication and customer service   shame on you 
2279,[11],trouble free from choosing to fitting  this was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and i have to say i'm totally pleased that i chose  the process of comparing  choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do  they have several top brands and a large overall choice and that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me you chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive  supply them the order number and abit of information like which tyres you want replacing etc and then sit back and they'll deal with everything  you can leave a review of the garage afterwards to help others decide you can even copy the appointment info straight into the calendar which is a nice touch  the app links to mapping services to direct you to the garage if the garage offers other services you can order these aswell  but if there's a charge then you will have to pay that direct to the garage while there the customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms the phone app was recommended to me and i'll certainly be recommending it to other people i know who can benefit from the service prices are competitive and i found them to be cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price i pay includes fitting and vat means i don't need to separately pay the garage aswell if you don't require fitting then for a reduced price they will deliver the tyres straight to an alternative address if you need to cancel your order for any reason then they don't question it or try to convince you not to  they simply issue a full refund  no pressure at all  easy my experience with  was excellent  i will be using the service next time i require tyre services takes the worry out of searching  buying and arranging fittings

2282,"[9, 11]",i got the tyres i wanted fitted at home at a good price  however they changed the time and date slot that i chose when i booked online and only told me by email which i don't check too often  the work was done by a seemingly new and inexperienced lad  he worked hard though  kudos to him  price is good  especially for a mobile service

3027,[2],easy to use website - good that you identify tyre type from car reg - fair pricing - efficient booking system for tyre fitting service
3028,"[4, 9]",generally a good service  booking problems aside there seems to be a communication problem between fitter and website which meant i had to collect the tyre from one fitter and have it fitted at another partner due to a calendar issue both the customer services at  and the fitters helped in any way they could  just a bit frustrating prices were good and  apart from the glitch  everything worked as it should  for 2 different cars with tyres fitted over a 3 day period at 2 different fitters  i requested the brake check  just for safety's sake and neither fitters i went to actually did it  that was a little irritating 
3029,"[4, 9]",dont trust this garage   were fine and the tyres were at the garage as expected  the garage fitted them fine  but then they told me my brakes were worn  they quoted me £170 to sort  i thought that was a bit steep and went to another garage later in the day    they told me nothing wrong with my brakes at all  wan'st impressed with first garage and won't be using again 
3030,[4],this is a pitstop not a garage  drive in  met by tyre specialist  drive through get out  approx 40-50min wait  go back  sign off  get in drive out  bish bash bosh  there isnt a waiting room  or rest room  the lads have basic tools to get the job done  would be nice if they themselves had somewhere to stay warm or at least wash their hands/somewhere to put snacks or even pee  i was happy with my service in and out  thanks lads   good job done  😃
3031,[4],tyres good price and fitting good too  down side    i added a two wheel tracking to order but the garage charged me more for it as they said they don’t do a 2 wheels tracking and had to have a 4 wheels alignment  my point is that on a berlingo van you can only adjust the two front wheels  so how can they charge for a 4 wheel alignment when they could only adjust 2 wheels   
3032,"[7, 11]",very easy to use web site  good competitive prices and tyres fitted with no problems encountered on the specified day
3033,"[9, 11]",very happy with   cheaper than anywhere else and good availability  work carried out with no problems
3034,[4],look elsewhere unless you want your alloys damaged  i used this company and their agent  mercia motors  and they chipped recently fully professionally refurbished alloys on our car  following previous bad experience with that garage we took photos of all 4 alloys  we even told them that they were unmarked when the car went in  we did not sign the job sheet to say we were satisfied  we complained to  about their agent and they then took several weeks before denying responsibility  neither they or their agent could give a toss despite the evidence  use someone you can trust and that's neither of these muppets  
3035,"[3, 9]",awesome price  had to wait a while for the tyres to come in stock  but excellent service and updated at all times

3056,[9],left me stranded dont care about customers   cancelled my fitting at the 11th hour and left me stranded for an urgent trip i needed to go on the following day  they think postponing a fitting by nearly a week at the last minute is ok  their early fitting date was the only reason i used them  when i emailed them asking for help getting the tyres fitted sooner they just ignored me  they seem to do business on their therms only  so prepare to be rightly screwed over  coz one thing is sure    they don't give a f*^k about their customers  thanks putting me in this mess guys  really great doing business with you 
3057,"[4, 9]",i have used  before and been very happy  the tyres were ordered & delivered for fitting at a local partner garage with no issues and a good price  i have given four stars due to the service by the garage who made a real mess of the tracking after their free check  this needed a return visit for a four wheel alignment which still didn’t provide the service i paid for

3286,"[4, 9]",garage was great  wasnt  overall  i'm really chuffed with the product  and the job the premier partner  carried out however  the customer service experience at  left a lot to be desired after it came to light i was consistently given incorrect information by email  and later on the phone to cut a long story short   appear to book jobs and services for you on their own system without consulting the garage you choose and their schedule for that given day i booked a tyre fitting for 4 new tyres and selected some additional services i was never given an appointment time  similarly  the services i selected were split across a friday and a monday not the end of the world  but the tyre fitting was scheduled for friday and tpms sensor valve replacement was scheduled for the monday for me it made more sense to fit the sensors on friday whilst the wheels are already coming off to fit the tyres anyway  i phoned to challenge this aspect and to double check why i wasn't given an appointment time i was told adamantly that the garage operated on a first-come-first-serve basis and that they couldn't provide the additional services i asked for i struggled to see the value in this system over scheduled appointments; but i went along with it as i had already paid for the tyres cut to: me the next day getting up super early to be the first person in this first-come-first-serve queue after arriving at the garage before the staff  i thought it was odd that no other people were rushing to get there first turns out that the garage has an appointment book  and  tell you it's first-come-first-serve  and split your services across a weekend for no other reason than to cause total inconvenience the garage was great though    i've had the car back there since and will continue to use them 
3287,[9],i had booked a day off for them to be fitted  only to be told it wouldn’t be delivered in time  so was given another date  wired for that date to be told i had to wait 3 days after that too  so all in all i lost 3 work days

3646,"[4, 11]",excellent prices and service i have used  several times over recent years  i require quality high performance tyres and they have always been the lowest price compared to all other suppliers online  on the most recent purchase i had an issue  and they contacted me as i requested and they resolved the issue i had straight away - how customer service should be  i have also never had any problems when i have attended one of their many fitting partners - also have the option for the fitters to come to the customer for a reasonable £6 extra charge - i’ve never used that option so can’t comment on its quality  out of curiosity i asked the recent fitting centre i had used how much the tyre supply and fitmeant would cost if i bought the tyre from them  i was surprised to hear that their fully fitted price for the exact same tyre would have been £75 more   i have no hesitation in recommending them to others - i hope they don’t allow their prices to rise  they remain competitive  and their customer service standards stay high 
3647,"[5, 11]",used bc few times over the last few years - they have consistently been the lowest price for top quality brands  my car requires high performance tyres and they have always stocked what i need  huge number of convenient fitters and also a mobile option  i’ve never had any issues with the service provided by bc or their fitting suppliers
3648,"[4, 9]",mainly because when my wife turned up at the garage with my 3 year old son the garage had only been sent 3 of the correct tyres  so my wife had to wait for an hour before the 4th tyre arrived  the garage told us they had contacted you the day before when the wrong tyre had arrived so you could let me know but i never had any contact from  regarding this  it was only by chance the tyre turned up as my wife was about to leave  not very impressed with her having to wait around when everything was booked especially having our young son with her  coming back was not really an option as we had things planned hence booking the time we did

3671,"[4, 9]",the jury is out  you massively messed up my booking  a customer services agent did resolve the issue  but it took several emails  and phone calls and time  i also think my wheel go damaged but very stupidly i did not take a pre and post picture  so at the moment i don't think i've had good value for money  i feel like i've had to try and fix your problem and 5 is a very strong score

3752,[9],surprisingly poor service  i've used  many times in the past and have been really pleased with the value for money and customer service  it therefore came as a shock to experience really poor service on this occassion everything seemed fine at first  my order went though and i was looking forward to having two reasonably priced tyres fitted at a convenient time on a saturday morning  later that day i received an email to say the garage could not fit my tyres on the saturday  that was slightly annoying but ok  i replied to the email to say their suggested fitting day of the following tuesday would be fine the next day i receive an email saying they can't deliver my tyres to the garage for the following tuesday  bearing in mind that it's only friday at this point and if so why was it even suggested to me as a possible fitting date  their new suggested day wasn't convenient and i was beginning to feel messed around so i replied saying it was becoming slightly ridiculous now and that i'd have to make alternative arrangements so please cancel the order  three days later and i still had not received a response or order cancellation from them  i sent an email suggesting rather sternly that they get their act together and cancel/refund my order  it was another day  nearly a wek after the initial order that it was finally cancelled  there was no apology  no explanation  nothing in their email i really am confused as to why  would think i should use them again or reccommend them to friends or family  having happily used them before  this is most certainly not the  that i remember

4379,"[4, 9]",2 new tyres and a lot of waiting around  the purchase and arrangement of 2 new tyres for fitting at a convenient local garage was good  the price was a noticeable saving  and the pre-arranged fitting time meant i was expected at the garage reception  so far so good  with full marks to  at this point  my question from this point on is: how come it took the garage over an hour and a quarter to actually fit the tyres   ok  they were diligent enough to check all the wheels before they started  and reported unusual tyre wear on the fronts - for which we agreed to check the alignment  but the alignment check and adjustment was only carried out after the aforementioned 1 25hrs  and trhe end result was a 2 hour visit  for 2 tyres  on a prearranged 1/2 hr slot  with 5 days notice  this to me is unacceptable - some people also have jobs to go to  and i wasn't anticipating this chunk of time taken out of my working day if red bull's f1 team can do it in 1 88 seconds with half a lap's notice   how come a major national chain can be as slovenly as this   not impressed  i will use  again  but not  to name names  ats

4407,[9],my prefferd garage doesn`t accept  fittings over a weekend so my wife had to take it during the week  not a massive drama obviously but if they wish to be a  fitment centre shouldn`t they accept weekend appointments

5058,[9],communication a little lacking  had to chase details the day before fitting then received a generic response
5059,[9],lots of messing around with the fitting dates 
5060,[1],best price and great customer service

5063,"[0, 2]",good value and excellent website and service 
5064,"[4, 9]",ordered wrong tyres  a quick phone call and the operator couldn’t be more helpful in resolving the issue
5065,[4],good tyres shame about the fitting  good prices and a very wide range of tyres  i have knocked off one star because the fitting place mismatched pressures by 7 psi across the axle i e  illegal and unsafe  fortunately i always check pressures myself but suspect many folks would assume it would be ok after a pair of new tyres had been put on 
5066,[9],very simple and efficient service  would have given a ten but would have liked to know my exact fitting appointment time initially rather than being given just am and then not being sure the exact time until later when i received another email with 9am

5068,"[6, 9]",the good bad  having used  many times i know how good the service can be  but on this ocassion the first agreed fitting date was was not completed  when i spoke to your representative who was very obliging finally managed to get a fitting date previously i have recommended you to several family and friends who have actually purchased tyres in the past but now i'm not confident in future recommendations 
5069,[4],second hand tyres do not buy  purchased a set of bridgestone tyres  was looking forward to putting them on a project car  but what i received was some old  dirty tyres with no manufacture markings  if i didn't know any better i'd think they were second hand tyres

5122,"[7, 9]",competitive prices  tyres delivered on time to fitting centre  unfortunately  the booking for fitting was not registered on their system - i assume this was their responsibility  fitting time delayed by 1 5 hrs 
5123,"[7, 11]",i looked on line for the tyres that i wanted   they had a offer of 10% discount  i ordered them online and 3days later had them fitted at a garage near to where i live 
5124,[2],best price available  easy to use site and service from garage was excellent 
5125,"[4, 9]",delivery failures which were avoidable  we had to wait over an hour past fitment time and when they’d remove the front tyres they discovered one of the new ones had been damaged in transit so they old tyre had to go back on followed by another 2 day wait  things like this can happen but it has put me off using this route  ultimately why wasn’t the tyre checked on delivery and couldn’t we have been told the pre-booked time was unachievable in advance  this two thins would’ve mitigated the sour taste now left 
5126,"[3, 5]",good price and reliable and convenient fitting 
5127,"[2, 9]",convenience  would choose a different fitting centre next time though 
5128,[2],efficient  price  information and accuracy of tyres available in order to make a viable choice 
5129,"[5, 11]",i love using   its so easy to use and the tyres to compare online are so diverse and broad  i only ever go for the same tyres but its always worth a look at the deals and also the prices of better brands 
5130,[4],hi  the fitting of the two front tyres fitted to my car as ordered  but  my computer stated that the tyres where under inflated and the dust caps on the valves were missing i had to re inflate to the correct pressures also  i went back to the fitter who stated that their systems were calibrated i think that this was a sloppy operation and should not happen on such a mundane task sending vehicles out on to the highway in such a maner could end in a tragedy

5453,[4],i have no fault with  ordering system or their availability of tyres however i do not feel that they properly inspect the standard of service being given by their garages  twice recently i have had poor service from the garage who fitted the tyres  the second occasion could have resulted in a dangerous failure by the garage to not properly tighten wheel nuts due to that job being apparently left to unsupervised trainees  as a result i will not be using that garage again for any purpose

5554,[5],best price on the tyres i wanted
5555,[9],it was very simple to arrange and i got to chose a garage myself  a friend of mine also did this a year ago and the garage he attended had not marked his tyres as being received so there was some confusion there  i was very lucky  i went to a different garage to avoid this mix-up and they knew my tyres had arrived before i dropped my car off  i would have given it a 10 if i had been given a more specific time slot 
5556,[4],mixed feelings  easy transaction  but car was handed back with the new tyres covered in adhesive which i had to wash off myself  got the impression that  customers were considered second class
5557,"[2, 3]",the choice of tyres is excellent with a range of fitting centres nearby

5563,"[5, 8]",best prices  hassle free 
5564,"[6, 9]",this is the second time i have used  and both times my appointment has been rescheduled the afternoon before  after i have arranged time off from work etc  a service that is meant to take the hassle out of shopping for tyres but instead only creates hassle 
5565,[9],having my appointment changed last minute  was very disappointing
5566,"[4, 11]",pretty smooth process impressed  pretty smooth process - order and then go to tyre shop for fitting  recommended by neighbour and have to say have also been satisfied  will go this way again so long as  don't try to squeeze the profit margins and whack the prices up  volume sales and turnover  steady income at moderate profit rather than try to retire in 2 years trying to make a stupid profit  kwik-fit should be worried  they and others have had this market ring fenced too long with ramped up prices 
5567,[7],very straightforward  both order and fitting
5568,[9],only 4 stars because my appointment was meant to be 11 o clock and on arrival i was told that it was 12  the garage said it was  miscommunication

6950,"[4, 9]",price was good and choice of fitting locations is helpful  generally satisfied with  just 2 issues:- once a fitting service is selected you are given a calendar to select the day and time  having selected an early morning time for my convenience at the designated supplier i was contacted later and told the time selected wasnt available  that was less convenient the supplier selected was the nearest & most convenient but they were a mainstream bmw garage and not a specialist tyre fitter  they were clearly more focused on their bmw customers and despite clear instructions fitted the replacement tyre on the wrong wheel  this was apologetically rectified but resulted in the fitting of one tyre taking 2 hours  instead of being fitted and on my way by 9-00 am as originally planned it was gone 12-00 when the job was completed

6953,"[4, 9]","unfortunately  you can't beat their prices  but i've had some mixed experiences  and i'm struggling to trust the honesty / integrity of the company as a whole 1) i booked a fitted service for my wife's car  and was given a timed appointment  which was really inconvenient   so i called customer service to see if it could be changed ""let me check with the garage"" said the lady on the phone  followed by ""the garage has no other availability on that day""  etc  etc  so i called the garage directly and explained that i'd like to come earlier if possible and got ""no problem sir  come along for when we open  and we'll get you straight in""    did customer service actually speak with the garage  given how accommodating they were when i called  i doubt it 2) different garage  and 4 tyres for my car    i had a very poor experience where it apparently took the garage 2 hours 10 minutes to change 4 tyres  and a very muddled experience from start to finish    they didn't have my paperwork  couldn't find my tyres  were questioning whether i was there on the right day  etc  and then the length of time to actually change the tyres  whilst mechanics floated aimlessly around the garage doing nothing  i took the time to write a detailed review of the garage on the  website  but that review hasn't been published weeks on  and the garage still has a 5 star rating  leading me to believe that  are trying to protect the reputation of their premier partner garages despite customer experiences "

7094,[11],straightforward  happy with the tyres and the fitting  will use  again
7095,[9],tyres arrived on time  sadly bathwick tyres who fitted the tyres were rude and unhelpful  they didn’t conduct allignment check  i had to wait three hours for the tyres to be fitted  poor service  
7096,[9],this is a first for me  two bad reviews about the same thing i left a review the other week after i was badly let down on an order half an hour before close of business on bank holiday weekend they posted some banal platitudes in response and somebody duly emailed me to apologise then the funny bit   you can only laugh  what else can you do along with the apology i was offered a £20 gift voucher and a 10% discount on future orders by somebody called katrina  i emailed a response  she never got back to me  i chased it a few days later     nothing given the original issue was the abysmal handling of the problem  it beggars belief that their `support team` can't even follow through on an offer  pathetic   but i'm sure you couldn't care less  
7097,[4],the cost was very competitive and the workshop that fitted the tyres didn't find unnecessary additional work  were courteous and efficient- thanks 
7098,[4],all good  used the mobile tyre service they offer and they turned up on time were polite and tyre prices on par with elsewhere  will use again

7102,"[4, 9]",my tyres were out of stock for a few days so i couldn't complete my order but once back in everything was easy to arrange and get sorted  annoyingly the garage didn't operate with an actual time they worked in morning or afternoon slots - i arrived after the school run and had to wait over an hour before they could even start on my car  thankfully it was within walking distance to some shops so i managed to waste some time there rather than being bored waiting  had to pay an additional cost for wheel alignment which apparently my car needed   though you never know how true that fact is or if they must wanted to earn some actual money themselves  i would use  again but may use a different garage that worked with actual times so i can plan my day better 
7103,"[4, 9]",issues with supply  communication and still issues with suspect balancing with my tyres

7116,[11],the process was beautifully smooth  i got decent tyres  at a great price  fitted at a convenient time  by a local specialist that i already knew and trusted  all organised in seconds on the  website  it's all the better  because my car is a 1971 sports car  and most tyre fitters  couldn't even get tyres in the right size will definitely use again 
7117,"[10, 11]",ok so they don't stock every variant  but all in all a very good service  very competitive pricing and quick delivery  £50 cheaper per tyre fitted at a tyre centre who could beat their price

7126,[9],first time using the website and will be using it again   love the range that the site has to offer for tyres and prices competitively if you are getting your newly purchased tyres fitted by black-circles partnered garage  i would call the garage of choice before confirming to use that garage to make sure that your tyre will be fitted at the time you specified or to make special requests and to gauge the customer service of the garage  i found that some garages wasn't as friendly as others  definitely recommend this site

7147,"[0, 8]",arrived within promised time window  friendly  efficient and knowledgeable staff member  tyres very good value as well 
7148,[4],best and worst experience  the fitter claimed that they balanced the wheels afterwarsd but after 5 minutes of driving  my fillings in my teeth were falling out after the amount of shaking the car was doing  also the fitter lost a locking wheel nut and damaged all the plastic caps that protect the bolts  however after speaking with the  team  they were extremely applogetic and covered the costs of getting this errors corrected  so overall the best and worst experience was had 
7149,[2],excellent website  excellent service

7152,"[4, 11]","i ordered a pair of avon tyres which i have used for years  there were cheaper tyres on offer but i would rather use a trusted brand  when i went to collect my car a pair of ""cooper"" tyres had been fitted  apparently these are the new owners of avon & ""equivalent""  if that had been made clear on the website or i had been told that i might get a brand i haven't heard of thats equivalent before hand i would have bought something else  you don't necessarily get what you pay for with  so i won't use them again "
7153,"[8, 9]",all 4 tyres fitted in the time i was told  friendly and helpful staff as usual  great job 👍
7154,[4],great price  but beware fitment does not include the standard practise of swapping rear tyres to the front  you will be charged extra for this by their fitment partner  we were charged the princely sum of £15 for the privilege 
7155,[4],i arrived at the garage slightly earlier as requested  it was explained that another job had to be finished before me but it would only take a few minutes  this was the case and the new tyre was soon fitted and all the paperwork completed

7245,[9],appointment fixed with local garage  tyres and fitting paid for on-line day before appointment  email from bc asking me to phone them told that garage has the tyres but cannot fit them  bc would try to find another fitting garage and get back to me another garage was found which would fit the tyres at the original appointment time the next day  but it was 8 miles from my home and    i had to collect the tyres from my local garage and transport them in my car boot to the new garage the next day  this was achieved without problems and i received £20 refund on the tyres   for my trouble  which i was happy with  not sure who the fault lies with but by giving 3 stars  it shaers the blame 
7246,"[4, 9]",i ordered a dunlop sp sport maxx 255/45 r17 w  tyre for my mercedes on the  website  as usual  i took a screen-shot of the 'order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records  shortly afterwards i received an email confirmation from  which indicated that i had ordered a bmw run-flat version of the dunlop sp sport maxx  i rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that i had not ordered the bmw run-flat version  even after i emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that i must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre  i have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and i suggest that  may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'order confirmation' screen  after you enter a tyre number   the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size  the large  headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre  4 and 5-star reviews  between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos  all the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon  presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane  some of the tyres then have various car logos - bmw  mercedes  ferrari etc as well as 'run flat'  and mo  there is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the dunlop sp sport maxx gt tyre with a bmw logo that makes it only suitable for a bmw  and how can that be anyway  and if it is  why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a mercedes tyre  which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen  and if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained then  having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle  why doesn't the 'order confirmation' screen include that fact  if i hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully i could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car so  if  want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to

7276,"[4, 9]",ordering the tyres online and getting them delivered was absolutely fine and they would get 5 stars for this  however the issues i had with the garage  after is the reason this gets a low star rating i was originally booked in for a saturday  i turn up  after getting a reminder of my booking via text i might add  the garage didn't have any fitters to do my tyres  they were sick  so i was a bit annoyed they couldn't have informed me before i left  but i don't blame them for people calling in sick  i was asked to come back on sunday so i turn up on sunday @ 11am and since i didn't need the car i was happy to leave it there all day  was told to come back at 4pm  i come back and they have not even started my car  i had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn't do the tracking i had requested with it  the only positive  and why i gave 2 stars and not 1  is they offered to do the tracking for free had to go back on tuesday  i turn up on time as requested  but they are not ready  ask me to come back in 45 minutes  so i do that  have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen  at the end they only did the front tracking  so i had to go back again on wednesday  this time i was seen within 20 minutes of arriving but overall the service was not good  having to go back 4 times just to have 2 tyres fitted and tracking  i will not be using that garage again  unfortunately for   i am running out of garages to try with them and get a good service  so i might soon be looking to get my tyres elsewhere

7384,"[9, 11]",this was my first time trying  com  i was desperate to get some tyres for the next day after picking up a puncture on the thursday and having a weekend trip leaving on the friday night and it's amazing how hard it is to get decent sport tyres for the next day as no-one carries stock  i'd first tried making a booking with kwik fit mobile fittings  they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back  the only other place i could find was  com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local hiq garage  it seemed too good to be true  hiq themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next tuesday yet  could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price  the reviews looked good so i took my chances and it was all smooth sailing  the appointment was first thing the next morning  tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done  it does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like national to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days  plus the price is very good  so i will certainly look to  com again in the future

7581,[2],this company was recommended to me by a friend and i found it really good   i was able to select the tyres that were suitable for my car while also following guidance provided  there is a wide range of tyres to choose from and the fact that one can select the nearest place to have the tyres fitted at their own convenient time makes this service excellent  
7582,[4],only thing was for this type of tyre it seems i had to go to ats in farncombe but just for convenience i might have preferred peugeot on hurtmore road-service at ats was great but i prefer the facilities whilst waiting at peugeot  😊
7583,"[2, 9, 11]","i have purchased tyres for a variety of domestic vehicles from  for some years  the website is informative and helpful  the range of tyres for each size is comprehensive  from budget to high performance  and there's a wide range of prices at market-leading rates  the ""order now and agree a fitting appointment in a few days' time  at your preferred centre"" usually works well  only once was delivery of my order delayed:  staff investigated promptly and re-arranged the appointment  while further-discounting my bill in compensation for my inconvenience  can't say fairer than that "

7587,[2],competitive price and choice of options  fitting location seemed to have conflicting information about booking but tried to meet expectations  i got the impression this wasn’t the first time it had happened 
7588,[7],hassle free booking from home good price fitted in good time on the date required 
7589,[2],great selection of tyres  good website makes it easier to choose and nice prices too 
7590,"[5, 10]",great service  prompt delivery but price could have been better 
7591,[9],after i placed my order  paid  and accepted a fitting slot  i was contacted by  and told that my fitting slot was being cancelled  because they were unable to deliver the tyres due to the weather the weather in question had been forecast over a week in advance  and before i placed my order  other businesses prepared and adapted   did not  they could have chosen to deliver the tyres to the fitting centre before the weather came  they had time to do this  alternatively  they could have set their website not to accept fitting slots in the days immediately after the poor weather  they did neither of these things when i eventually got my tyres fitted  the local garage that did the work were great  very friendly and helpful  i'm going to leave them a positive review elsewhere so that they're not tarnished by this one 
7592,[11],easy  reliable process  only went with  originally as i wanted certain tyres  the place where i had them fitted  could not supply and offered me something else  so i had the tyres i wanted fitted at the same place i normally go to  got the tyres “i” wanted for £40 less than i had been quoted by another garage 
7593,"[6, 11]",this is the first time i have used  and i am impressed  i brought 2 bridgestone tyres and they were £20 cheaper than if i brought them direct from my local tyre shop  the tyres were fitted at my local tyre shop and they said there was no way they could match the price  i put the money i saved towards having my wheel alignment done  happy days  will definitely use again and would recommend to friends and family

7605,[9],the time you book is apparently not the actual time you are offered so you have to replan the next day when they actually confirm your time  not sure why you would not just be honest from the start 
7606,"[4, 6]",i was delighted with the service  i made a mistake of ordering the wrong size tyres originally but the person on the customer service was very good natured and rectified the situation with no fuss at all  i will have no hesitation in using  again in the future 
7607,"[0, 11]",easy to use service which is good value for money compared to the high street however the discount code allocated to the tires i chose did not work at checkout so losing out on a £20 saving

7609,"[9, 11]",terrible customer service  got a refund in the end and bought the tyres from a garage
7610,"[1, 9]",appointment was on time and customer service was very friendly
7611,[4],tyres and  service and price was good   i didn't have confidence with the fitters  i asked them to torque the wheel bolts to 170nm  they said this was too tight but i insisted  i then watched them do the bolts up with an 'air gun' then apply the torque wrench to each bolt on each wheel but didn't see the wrench move before the toque  setting engaged suggesting that the 'air gun' had already done them up super tight  this is all well and good until i need to change a wheel at the side of the road and can't get the bolts undone without a breaker bar 
7612,[2],looked online for required tyres  good choice of tyres varying prices to suit budget  quick and easy booking service  fitted at exact time  no wasted time waiting  thank you  2nd time used  as well  highly recommend

7617,"[1, 2]",so easy to use  brilliant service
7618,[11],prices are the cheapest  the use of the online booking system is easy if you simply want a replacement tyre like for like  simply read off the side of the old tyre the descriptive sizing and input  choose a local fitting service listed and select the time and date of appointment  what could be easier  great service

7624,[4],got the tires i wanted at a competitive price  also got a few extras from the garage for free - wheel alignment checks and front brakes checked what wasn't so good was  tried to contact me to state that i needed run flats  i tried to call them back but lines closed early  then emailed them and although they came back to me they didn't read or take notice of my out of office therefore ended up turning up at the garage and just put on the tires that i had already bought  they also created a little unnecessary distress as it was made out that i couldn't apply non-run flats  the garage said it was all ok and tires now fitted so all good in the end  just unnecessary distress in the middle

7690,"[4, 7, 11]",it really couldn't have been easier  the bit that took the longest was deciding what make of tyres to for  once i made my mind up the rest was straight forward  pick a garage that's convenient to you and when you want them fitted  pay and it's all done

7694,"[9, 11]",more than happy with the efficiency of ordering on line and the tyres getting to the garage of my choice  however the offer of entering into a competition to win £100 of asda vouchers was a definite mistake  i have been inundated with calls from various companies trying to flog me broadband to lottery tickets  i was told i had actually won the asda vouchers  but he continued trying to sell me the lottery  my advice therefore is to avoid doing any competition 
7695,"[1, 10]",great service  pretty good price too 
7696,[11],so easy  it's all there on one page  your choice of tyres  costs  garages  everything  you just click and they do the rest  great 
7697,"[4, 9]", were efficient & courteous  however  3 things let them down 1  the original date that was booked had to be changed2  the original tyre that i chose from the website had an incorrect speed rating for my car  3  the quality of the garage that carried out the tyre change was a poorly run  garage where the housekeeping within was so poor that it was bordering on a dangerous environment to work in 
7698,[9],ordered 2 tyres to be fitted in time for mot  arranged work around the appointment  the evening prior i received a text and email stating the tyres were not available and my date had been changed to 2 days later called the help line and was given no apology or real reason  other than the tyres could not be sourced on time after a lengthy discussion explaining the inconvenience they reluctantly offered a £15 refund tyres fitted and all ok

7709,"[5, 11]",best price i could find for the tyres i wanted after shopping around and fitting arranged as quickly as anywhere else could 
7710,"[2, 11]",very easy to use web site with plenty of choice of tyres 
7711,[9],we ordered 4 winter tyres and had three delivered   this is the second time that tyres were not available in this country  they could not locate a fourth tyre  consequently  it took an hour and a half on the phone and eventually we had to re-order a different set of tyres and return the three tyres to a local garage  and at one point we had seven new tyres in our hallway the phone operatives are very helpful  but this company needs to sort out it’s delivery  if the tyres are not in stock don’t take payment and certainly don’t deliver part of an order 
7712,[3],very poor service from the fitting centre  should vet more carefully 
7713,"[1, 6]",fast and brilliant service definitely be using  again  
7714,[10],quick  convenient and reasonably priced
7715,[4],first time using  and it was a pleasure  had just bought a spare wheel which needed a tyre  i didn't want to pay the normal price as i had just had to buy one the  web site was easy to use and gave the option of a few budget tyres  i shose the cheapest as it is only a spare and ordered it having chisel one of their premier fitters  the fitting time came through which was not convenient so called  who quickly rearranged the time for me turned up and immediately the wheel was taken  the new tyre fitted and balanced and then bought back to the car and put in the boot  great service all round and will definitely use them again and have already spread the word  i ebded up paying just lass than a third of the price of the originally fitted one

7782,[6],a first class experience 10/10
7783,"[4, 7]",the online order was easy and the fitting at the lakeside pit-stop took about an hour my only frustration point was the guy at the fitting centre who took my phone no  and promised to call me once the job is done but didn't  also at the end he was quite pushy begging for a 5-star review  in fact he mentioned that 4 or 5 times  it seems that the review was his main and only concern

7819,[9],i have used bc before and been happy  but on this occasion i had to wait two weeks and had 3 cancelled appointments  i even had reminders about the appointments  but when i turned up they hadn't even delivered the tyre to the garage  i won't be using them again

7843,[9],tyre centre advertising time slots they cannot fulfill had to rebook at a later date  then when appointment rebooked very slow service  arrived at appointed time but car left waiting for 35minutes before they even started the job which then took 2 hours to fit 4 tyres  can’t complain about the workmanship but being expected to wait that long in a grotty waiting area is unacceptable

7866,"[7, 11]",ordered my caravan tyre online and selected my fitter  all went well no probs great communication at all times during the purchase and fitting  will definitely use again 
7867,[4],tyres and delivery all good  used premier  fitting shop and alloys were damaged in tyre change  management claimed they were damaged prior to the tyre change which is not true  i had only just had the alloys refurbed wish i had taken a photo before i left car with them  there was no joint pre inspection  sad you can’t trust
7868,[3],good products at a good price 
7869,[9],last minute delay in delivery of tyres was sorted after phone call  local fitters very helpful 
7870,"[9, 11]",great service - tyres arrived at appointed garage and at the right time  not a huge saving price wise but every little bit helps

7872,"[4, 11]",tried out a quality budget tyre  and when fitted i found them to be very good hope they last without any problems --- can't go wrong to get two tyre's for the price of one well-known brand
7873,[7],very competitive prices  tyres fitted in local just tyres by a knowledgeable  friendly engineer  have used before and will use again 
7874,"[3, 9]",good prices  tyres were good quality and did turn up   eventually  communication + delivery from  towards fitting garage was lacking  i order 2 tyres including fitting  fitting date pushed back twice )  went to appointment and was told on phone some time later that only 1 tyre had turned up  following multiple phone calls  emails and multiple additional appointment changes i finally got my 2nd tyre fitted almost 3 weeks after i ordered it  people on phone were nice and helpful but logistics / service delivery not so great 
7875,[4],"i have used  several times  in three different fitting garages with excellent results  easy to order  easy to pay and great communications from the company  unfortunately  my latest experience was married slightly by the tyre fitting garage having an attitude that made me feel like i was in the way  the fitter spent 10 minutes on his mobile phone in the middle of the job and when i asked the receptionist if they would swap the tyres ""front to back and back to front"" i was told there would be a charge of £6 99 per wheel  despite the car already being raised to fit two new tyres  i'll definitely be using  again but not at that particular fitting shop "
7876,"[0, 1]",quick reliable inexpensive service 
7877,"[3, 11]",efficient online ordering service but fitting partner used in this instance was not helpful  it felt like other customers were getting preferential treatment because i had purchased through  rather than direct with the fitting partner 
7878,[4],already done a review
7879,[9],did not update time on website so booked in to an unavailable slot  when told slot not available help desk was not helpful and only asked when i was available which considering they could not tell me when the garage was available led to a chicken and egg situation  although tyres were fitted well at the garage   but not be very good middle men
7880,[9],used  a fair few times with no issues  the most recent time they cancelled the tyre fitting via email stating garage couldn’t support the fitment  i went to the garage who could support it  so had a lengthy process to get it re booked with calls not getting answered  would be better for  to call the garage to confirm rather than just cancelling via an email which may go unnoticed  2 minute job 
7881,[8],i had two michelin pilot sport 4's fitted   were the cheapest i found and uckfield motors fitted without any issues 
7882,[9],slight hick-up getting all four tyres for delivery  fitting date missed twice  however  kept me updated of the problem causing the delay  mobile fitter used was excellent

7902,[5],always use   unbeatable prices and very convenient  why go elsewhere 
7903,[5],tyeres came on time flitted on time couldn't ask for a better service
7904,[11],everything went to plan  fitting went without a clinch  the only minus point was that the tyres cost more than another supplier but the‘’ fitting partner was closer for travel 
7905,[4],i ordered four tyres  knowing i needed two fronts and there was a nail in one of the rear tyres  the ordering was straight forward  simple and easy to use and all done within 10 mins  when i needed to change the installation date  a quick call to customer services and all was sorted in 15 minutes with confirmation of my new desired installation date sent through on the day  the fitter pointed out that i had more than 50% tread on the rear tyres  after inspecting the nail in the rear tyre and realising it was ~2mm long and had not affected the tyre it was decided only the front tyres would be changed ringing up to arrange for the two surplus tyres was quick and painless  with the money being issued back to me within 48 hours exceptional customer service from start to finish and why i’ll keep coming back as a customer 
7906,[11],basically it worked  i bought 4 tyres  and saved over £60 including fitting locally
7907,[7],very easy to buy tyres  arranged with local fitter through   highly recommend

7922,"[2, 4, 11]",never used before but i found it easy to use a local garage to fit my tyres rather than drive 15 miles to get what i wanted which was good quality budget tyres  i ended up buying own brand and they seem to be excellent so far  definitely worth a try in my view 
7923,[11],after shopping round for all terrain tyres i found the site  com  it was so easy to select a tyre and have them fitted at a local garage  on this occasion i need specialist tyres but would definitely use for normal tyres  so much easier than going to various garages or phoning round  i will be using  com again 
7924,[4],very good  order normal tires by mistake instead of run flats it was then that noticed and contacted me to make me aware and changed them without any fuss

7930,[11],tyres in time  needed 4  looked at all tyres and judged the tyres chosen as the best middle range  look good and seem to do the job  only time will tell if they are value for money  the surprised look on the tyre fitters face when he saw the brand was a worry but hopefully just because we didn't by direct from ats 
7931,[9],i bought rotallia and they send me different brand and they inform me after 5 days  1 day before my appointment  i booked same extra service but we they fit the tyres they didn't check them  poor service from  and from garage as well

7938,"[4, 9]",after a case of misinformation with an order a week earlier  i was given a 10% discount off my next order  as my wife needed two new tyres i decided to give bc another go  this time it was faultless with correct communication regarding fitting time and the selected fitter completed the job within 15 mins of me arriving  confidence restored

7950,"[7, 9]",easy booking online and fitter was quick when he arrived  would have liked a shorter time slot rather than waiting most of the morning  or a live update on fitter arrival 
7951,[9],great prices and buying experience but queries take a while to be resolved  on the whole my experience with them is great  the only reason i’ve given them 4 stars is due to how difficult it is to reach their customer services  by email only in my experience which goes to a central mailbox  once it’s there you are dealt with - not necessarily with the same person throughout the query and it took a couple of days to settle my query with emails going back and forth - but it does get sorted  but in my experience you just can’t get through over the phone which for me was just a little frustrating and meant my query settlement took days instead of being sorted in one phone call  but the prices are great and my local fitting centre was absolutely brilliant 
7952,"[7, 11]",very easy to use and surprisingly cheap especially having 19” low profiles i was extremely happy with the price and speed in which the tyre was ordered and fitted 👌🏻

8210,"[5, 9, 11]",you don’t need to tread carefully with  tyres   they are the best value with the fullest range   you also get a timed appointment at a local tyre fitting service but best to check the day before as confirmation is sometimes delayed

8213,[6],this is the second time i have used  and the service was brilliant at the chosen fitment centre  thoroughly recommend them 
8214,"[4, 9]",i was surprised and disappointed at the length of time it took to fit 2 rear tyres to my car  i left the car with the fitters 10 mins before the appointed time but it was 1 1/2 hours after the appointed time before my car was ready  just as well i had no other appointments that day i had no complaints with  but would certainly not use autowise fitters again
8215,[9],booking was cancelled 3 times by ats under various excuses
8216,[4],the garage service was bit disappointing  the service by  was excellent but the garage was bit disorganised and charged me an extra £5 00 for wheel alignment on top of the charges quoted on the  website which is not indicated but other garages were showing extra charge on the site

8219,"[4, 9]",first time order from  tyres ordered fine and i was offered an or pm  chose pm thinking it meant i could go anytime in the afternoon to get tyres replaced  day later got email with time i was expected at fitters  emailed back to say that i couldn’t do the time given due to work and that 4:30 to 6pm would be best if possible  email came back later the same day with a 5pm time slot  got to tyre fitters and they said they could not get wheels off to change tyres due to stripped locking wheel but key  said they couldn’t do it as they closed at 6pm and it was now 5:45pm  they requested i get lockers removed and then come back  i asked about making another appointment and they told me it would be an issue holding the tyres or getting them fitted when i got back  the next day i was able to get one of the nuts off by myself but was unable to get other off  went to another garage over weekend who got it off  took car back to tyre fitters and they fitted new tryres without a problem  so moral of this story  check you locking wheel nuts before taking you car in to get the tyres replaced

8283,"[0, 10]",really good company to use and good value
8284,[3],very quick & simple  & good quality tyres at very good prices well done
8285,[4], is a great service  but don’t take the recommended tyre size  i done this and wrong tyres were sent to the garage  it’s worth getting the size from your car  to be fair to  i phoned them and they sent someone to pick up wrong tyres and offered me £20 off the correct tyre as it was quite a bit more expensive  but the person i spoke to was very polite and helpful 
8286,[4],i had my tyres fitted by one of the approved garages  formula one  in newport pagnell  the tyres were fitted  no problem  but when returned to my car the drivers seat was dirty  i went straight to the office to say it looked like they had sat in the car in dirty overalls  he came and looked at the seat and asked me where the mark was and i said it was all over  he acted like he couldn't see anything but it was obvious that the seat was dirty  he also said that their staff always put a cover on the seat  he did ask if i wanted them to vacuum the seat and i declined and asked if i could have a protective cover for the seat and i would sort it out myself  i was not happy with the way i was treated like i was seeing things and do not feel my complaint was handled correctly  i will not be using them again  this is not black circles fault but makes me think twice as this garage is supposed to be a trusted trader for them 
8287,[10],good service 
8288,"[6, 11]",excellent value for money and first class service every time  if you want to cut your motoring costs then this is the tyre company to use  a great range of budget to performance tyres for all your needs  highly recommend 
8289,"[4, 11]",why not try to experience great money saving adventure for choosing right tyres with reasonable comparison with other top branded products  i like the option for tyres and details for picking exactly right choice considering this and that  however  the fitting time took more than 1hour even if it seems simple to work  the reason was my car was abandoned more than 30 minutes as the priority of their work was not mine  it could be the only problem of joint business with other garage  but i was so happy that i fully enjoy the new tyres 
8290,"[4, 11]","the bloke who fitted the tyres was great - turned up on time - knew his stuff - no problem at all there they quote an all-inclusive price for fitted tyres so i was a bit niggled to find that when their website advertises x% off it means x% off the tyres and 0% off the fitting  so it cost me a couple of pounds more per tyre than it led me to believe  yes  i know what it says in the  small print but when it says ""discount"" in size 60 font and ""subject to terms and conditions"" in size 6 font and you can only find the terms and conditions in the bottom of locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a notice on the door saying ""beware of the leopard"" it doesn't quite give the impression that you'd expect of a straightforward business  i'd rather they gave a smaller % discount honestly applied to the whole price "
8291,"[4, 9]",purchased two new michelin run-flat tyres and selected a fitting date with my local garage all through the  website securing a great deal with a 10% flash sale discount  however  a day before the fitting i was told the tyres were not available and offered a pair of pirelli’s for the same price  i would have liked the option of my preferred michelin not available at time of the purchase or not available on the website  as i wanted the michelin i declined and opted for a refund  this did not materialise within the 3-5 days  a quick email after that period fixed that problem and money back in account 3 days later  it happens  definitely will use  again as their a great company  as for the fitter they were fine but took ages to fit the two tyres  i dropped car off at 8am and earliest i could get it was 2pm  i had booked a early morning appointment  oh well 
8292,[3],choice and price excellent and prompt delivery
8293,[4],replaced tyres at the recommended garage  document  said all tyre pressure were 2 3 bar however  1 tyre pressure was so low when i picked up the car  i went to another garage to fill air  do not believe what those documents says 
8294,[9],really easy to order tyres  the system told me which tyres i needed for my car and then i could choose whicj budgets to spend  then they even offered a home change so they actually sent someone out to fit them  couldn't have asked for better  sam
8295,"[4, 7]",good price tyres local garage to fit ok      but couldn't find the locking wheel nut when it was in its proper place in the car  
8296,"[4, 9]",good price but i took off a star because the fitters i chose  ats on kedleston road in derby  took an hour and a half from my appointment time to fit 2 front tyres 
8297,"[4, 6]",i had to change x 2 tyres urgentlywas very pleased to find a contractor who came to my home address first class job had the wheels balanced on saturday would recommend them without hesitation
8298,[7],straightforward and simple  convenient too  no hassle fix  thanks
8299,"[4, 9]",pretty poor experience overall   delayed my tyres by a few days beyond when it was agreed they would be fitted  when tyres were eventually fitted they were the wrong size and having driven my car  i damaged my two alloys  nothing was offered by way of compensation other than the meaningless ‘sincere apologies’  they did offer to fix my alloys and have them them re cut  but nothing else  when the correct tyres were due to be fitted they again delayed the order and i’m hoping  that the correct tyres will be fitted tomorrow  i’ve had my car sitting in my drive for several days waiting for  to rectify their error  i hoped putting a customer out by a week might concern them but it really doesn’t  in summary they put themselves forward as a friendly  quirky service with their customer servers and personal bios stating they live in edinburgh and enjoy watching tv  spending time with family and hillwalking  while they enjoy things like this  it’s pretty clear they don’t give one care about providing a good service and carrying out a simple task such as delivering and fitting a tyres  i will never be using them again  if you live in the highlands just go anywhere else  regardless of the cost  these guys are just absolutely useless

8319,[8],5 stars: excellent – no reservations  i would recommend this company to anyone

8321,"[4, 9]", itself is ok but the service station i opted for - ets euoromaster stirchley - has no concept customer service and lack professionalism  i was there to replace one tyre  in that time  my car seat positioned was changed  my heating was on full blast even though it was a nice sunny day if i had not looked in my boot  i would have lost my clip they have no concept of service with a smile

8438,[9],booked an appointment at a local garage via   was then told it was unavailable and was changed to another  supposedly in 'my area'  it wasn't but i made plans to get there anyway  this was then also cancelled and i was finally given another garage which was a further 10 miles away and troublesome to get to due to renowned traffic in the area  got fitted ok  complained about the experience with  and was offered a discount and minor compensation  this was 2 weeks ago and still not heard anything despite a number of emails sent  very poor service

8442,"[4, 9]",my jaguar came back from the garage with break fluid leaking from the front of my car when i only had rear tyres fitted  the garage was more than helpful to sort things out however  promised that a manager would call me back about the complaint but i am still waiting a week later for this  terrible customer service from  from now on i will use halfords or kwik fit as i have never had problems with them

8455,[0],easy  fast and convenient 
8456,[9],the ordering process is very easy to use and convenient  it allows you to book a fitting at the nearest garage  i placed the order on wednesday for a friday fitting  on thursday afternoon i received an email stating there was an issue delivering my tyre to the garage and that my fitting was being rebooked to tuesday  i had to phone  as i had already made arrangements and taken time off work to have the fitting on friday  i am reliant on my vehicle for transport to work and of course this meant that i would be without a vehicle for another 4 days    were unable to keep the friday booking and i was offered a small compensation by the rep on the phone  i kept the booking on tuesday as the tyre which i ordered was only available through   come tuesday there was no further problems the garage i chose was spot on  i awaited the compensation to be refunded back  another week goes by and there was no sign of any compensation or any communication  so i rang  who told me there was no note on their system regarding me being given any compo this was sorted the following day and i did receive the amount promised overall i would say this was a rough ride ordering from   it's a shame they are failing at such little things and leave you stranded  the whole point of ordering a tyre from the internet is so that it is convenient and reliable  unfortunately i can't say this about  at this point in time if you are pushed for time i would rather recommend going to a local garage and pay the premium but get your tyres done the same day 
8457,[4],would use  again  excellent service  but wouldn't have ats inverness fit them  they said my wheel alignment was miles out but the tyres that came off where 2mm across the full tread and no shoulder wear  think there trying it on
8458,[9],on this occasion  let me down  numerous other times they have been outstanding  by not communicating with me i would have been left waiting for my tyres and would have lost money through no work  autotest in ewell were absolutely brilliant and contacted me as soon as the tyres were in and then fitted me in to fit them

8464,[9],very goodwould have liked somewhere closer and a sooner available date
8465,[9],good enough website  delays in my order meant rescheduling of time off work which was inconvenient and garage itself was particularly unprofessional & useless
8466,[4],got shifted from one garage to another  which took me out of my way a bit  but shire hill garage in saffron walden were friendly and efficient so no complaints  saved about £50  on four tyres which is ok  so overall a good experience

8492,[6],i always use  and will continue too 
8493,[4],everything it was nice the only comment i have is that in order to do the tracking adjasment they asked £60 while near by they ask £50 or less without earning fron the tyres 
8494,[4], used to offer to best price in the market and an accurate fitting time but not anymore the prices have gone up considerably and the fitting times much more loosely offered also  to top it all  the fitter changed a perfectly good tyre with around 5mm of tread  the fitters were apparently pretty unfriendly and she didn’t want to go back to question their mistake all in all i don’t think i will use  in the future  over the years i must have ordered 20 tyres for myself  friends and family so i was pretty loyal 
8495,"[2, 9, 11]",i saved a significant amount of money but had a wide choice of tyres whilst only having to wait a few days to have them fitted by a reputable company

8576,[10],competitive prices and good  convenient service
8577,"[6, 11]",bought a pair of motorcycle tyres  very competitive price helped by a flash sale but what did impress was the speed of delivery  would definitely recommend
8578,[5],the best companie with the best service 
8579,[11],would have liked a better range of tyre options for my car and maybe being able to search for a particular manufacture  otherwise can't complain 
8580,[9],was informed by  that i had an appointment at 11:45  when i got there on time  i was informed i had to wait for an hour  apparently  the garage had told  it was an am appointment 
8581,[10],good price  fast delivery 
8582,[0],tyres are great value for money
8583,[4],tyres themselves were fine but the tyre pressure sensor was broken and the garage was unable to fix so i had to buy a replacement from main dealer and then go to another tyre fitter to have sensor fitted and programmed costing extra 
8584,[10],always easy to use  good prices and the choice of where to have fitting done is ever increasing 
8585,"[4, 6]",very efficient service  fitter turned up within the time given and took great care not to damage my newly refurbished wheels  will definitely use the on-the-drive service again

8587,[5],a good experience from start to finish 
8588,[0],overall easy service and saved money which was a bonus
8589,[2],easy and straightforward to use   good selection of tyres available  got my van booked in nxt day at nearest tyre fitters in my area
8590,"[6, 11]",top rate  as usual 
8591,[4],the tyre fitters started early and did a great job  the car was carefully jacked using a scissor lift and rubber pads  the right tyres fitted the right way round  pressured and torqued using a torque wrench  always good to see  the only downside was the car was rear ended and written off 12 hours later  will use  again on its replacement 
8592,"[4, 9]",nice idea but double check garage has equipment  it turned out that the garage selected didn‚äôt have the equipment required to change the tyres  my husband ended up losing a day taking the car to a 2nd garage  there is now a clunking sound under the car - so will have to take it to a third garage to get this looked at 
8593,"[1, 6]",efficient  immediate and solid price  many thanks  😊
8594,"[1, 5]",used  for years and have always had great service with no issues whatsoever  always have a great choice of premium tyres available at competitive prices too

8596,"[6, 8]",i was well impressed with the  service   i would use this service again  
8597,[10],great service and good prices
8598,"[4, 9]",had the best prices out of all the choices i found  i chose the mobile service due to the car having a failed mot  was a bit shaky to begin with  having been told my appointment was unavailable and having a new date set - i didn't receive confirmation and was informed my request went to the wrong department they arranged it once more and everything was fine  the mobile fitter got there as early as possible and were fast and polite overall a good experience  despite the hiccup at the start   the  staff were friendly and helpful this service was perfect for my circumstance  just keep in mind urgent appointments probably aren't likely 
8599,[9],using website was easy and prices very competitive  great selection of fitting sites near me and was able to book within two days  however i did receive an e-mail the following day advising the selected fitting time was no longer available  on contacting the customer service centre the staff were extremely helpful and offered to contact the fitting centre for alternative times  they called back within 5 minutes  fantastic customer service on arriving at the fitting centre they were waiting for me tyre fitted and no issues  overall great experience would not hesitate to recommend 
8600,"[4, 9]",i suppose the only “complaint” is that i could not wait on site for the tyres to be done  the tyre fitter was busy  although i had arrived at opening hours on a saturday morning on their recommendation and had to leave my car for three hours  it would have been acceptable if i had had a hard and fast appointment time otherwise the tyre changes were as expected  two thumbs up there 
8601,[6],second time used  will continue to do so
8602,"[5, 11]",tyers no prob
8603,[0],quick  easy and efficient
8604,[0],simple  easy and good value
8605,[4],the actual purchasing and delivery of my four new cross climate tyres from  went smoothly enough  my problems started when the partner garage  could not accommodate me on the date i booked on line and i therefore had to rearrange it and wait a further week as it needed to be a weekend  the tyres seemed to be fitted fine but i had to ask them to find my locking wheel nut key as it was not in the car  a few days later i took my car to the kia dealership for mot and service  the car failed because the tyre on the rear drivers side had been fitted the wrong way round   apparently the tyres are directional  kia sorted out the tyre for a cost and passed the car and the garage who fitted the tyres reimbursed me for that cost  i chose auto pfect because  rated them as a premium fitter  and despite the staff being friendly and generally helpful  the mistakes made were very basic and avoidable for a professional tyre fitting garage  i certainly wouldn't trust them to provide other services and will stick to the trusted main kia dealer 
8606,[9],the tyres i ordered were to be delivered wednesday last week  however three arrived wednesday and the remaining tyre arrived friday  this was after my scheduled fitting and caused me to have to cancel and reschedule  one positive was the online chat which was very quick to respond although never delivered update emails promised on my outstanding delivery 
8607,"[3, 5]",good choice of tyres from cheap never heard of brands to the top of the shop branded ones  good prices and a choice of garages to have them fitted

8626,"[6, 11]",a great service which is so conveiniant to get tyres fitted for a very good price would definately recommend using the company 
8627,[9],all in all a great service  there was a little confusion on the expected delivery times of my new tyre to my local garage  this confusion was caused by mixed messages in the emails from   one email said that the tyre was going to be late and i needed to rearrange which i did  then another email said the tyre would now not be late and the original time slot was still available  but i was not aware of this update until it was too late to confirm  a third email confirmed a new time slot -for a date that was yesterday  obviously i challenged this and they then corrected the mistake  in the end the tyre change went well  no hiccups in the garage  would still use  again  just wish for more clarity and less confusion in future 
8628,"[5, 9]",best service ever    arrived the next day

8632,"[0, 7]",easy  straightforward and good value  really appreciated the specified fitting slot at the garage 
8633,[1],cracking service  no hassel at all
8634,[9],tyres weren't ready for the scheduled fitting date and at very late notice  after 5pm the day before that date ingot an email advising of a new fitting date two days later  why couldn't you provide a reasonable lead time for the fitting date in the first instance
8635,[1],professional service from start to finish
8636,[6],my first experience with  very impressed with staff and service first class
8637,[3],all happened on time as described with a choice of 2 fitters in my very local area 
8638,[4],i've given it 4 stars because  is easy to use and saves alot of shopping round  but  the fitting company i used  wiltshire tyre and auto centre in melksham  was not very good at all  ok  so  no attempt was made to cover up the seats or floor despite the fitter getting in my beautifully clean car wearing dirty clothes and muddy boots  the waiting room was filthy  you would walk out dirtier than when you walked in  despite paying £250 00 for my tyres  a coffee whilst waiting still cost £1 00  when fitted  i was urged to sign the paperwork to confirm that i'd been offered a look at the car post fitting to make sure i was happy  but hadn't  no attempt was made to remove the mud that was now in my car and dust that was on the seats and other places after fitting i would use  again   but will avoid this fitting centre at all costs 
8639,[5], com are spot on 
8640,[10],efficient and courteous our local garage mckinnons fittedgood price from 
8641,"[4, 9]",i used to swear by  and recommend them all the time  however  their service has gone down hill of late with two successive orders going wrong due to delivery issues  fitting appointments being double booked etc  for the sake of saving a few quid just go direct to ats  i did  and the job got done where and when i wanted it 
8642,[10],easy  good price and service 
8643,[4],not great  i think i would have got a better service else where  i requested the garage to maintain my original bmw metal dust caps but they didn’t  replying: they’re not original mate  so i didn’t bother  regardless of whether he thought they were  i don’t see the problem  they also said one of the wheels was corroded so required a bead seal  i’m not entirely sure it was but i got charged an extra £24 for the privilege  they also damaged the wheel while putting on one of the new tyres  i think they disturbed an old kerb repair but again their mentality was one of complete denial  i won’t be using this service again  i can see why people just got to main dealers 
8644,[11],cheaper than anywhere else and you can get them fitted at a reputable garage of your choice
8645,"[6, 11]",excellent company to purchse tyres from  i've bought tyres through  for a number of years and find their prices are competitive locally and their partner tyre fitting services i've used are excellent too  i shall continue to buy with bc for as long i need tyres

8653,"[4, 9]",tyre wasn’t delivered in time for fitting  the next fitting appointment was then cancelled  result of all the delays was my car getting a flat tyre  and being stranded at the side of the road with my children and having to pay a different company to rescue me and my tyre  the man at the fitting garage when i managed to get there was then rude and unhelpful 
8654,"[1, 6]",great service and price  would recommend
8655,[11],total satisfaction with my transaction
8656,"[5, 10]",always a good price for my tyers
8657,"[4, 7]",ordering was easy and transparent  garage for fitting was the most professional tyre fitter i have used  staff were friendly  all previous rim damage was noted and signed for before fitting 
8658,[9],except for a late change to appointment time due to an apparent misbooking at ats
8659,[9],not the cheapest but required a in common tyre fitted on the drive which happened on time despite receiving an email the afternoon before saying the tyre was not in stock and to re arrange 4/6 days later

8670,[9],my tyres hadn’t been delivered by my appointment time  wasted an afternoon waiting for them to be delivered 
8671,"[9, 11]",the cost was lower than the cheapest quote i'd managed to get and the fitting was at one of those that had originally quoted and the service was the same  very easy to organise and will use again 
8672,[4],ats were fine when fitting  although nearly 90 mins for 2 tyres  the tyres themselves are awful  i've skidded sideways in a car park with them already at only 5mph luckily     and they seem to have very little grip around corners in damp or worse conditions  the car feels like it'll slide at very low speeds  these were admittedly the budget tyres at 75 pound each  but should be better than this  i'm driving an a6 2 litre tdi by the way    
8673,"[2, 7, 9, 10]",couldn't be simpler
8674,[3],great prices  excellent service  one satisfied customer again

8676,[4],tried to order run flat tyres took 3 calls to the call centre to get a choice then when the garage had fitted the tyres they then found out that the tyres that were delivered were not run flat and had to go through the call centre again to get the tyres re-ordered and re book the fitting  this is the first time in 6/7 years i have had any bother with  but it still was unacceptable and not the service i had expected 
8677,[9],not very interested  i have recently had tyres fitted at tweeddale motors in peebles  my second visit through  and they are absolutely fantastic  friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with  the reason for the poor rating is this  before my first visit to tweeddale motors i had arranged for a fitting in penicuik  i went to get the tyres fitted and was told that  customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection  i was unable to do this and said that i would have to return another day  looking at the  website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location  so i arrived at opening time a couple of days later  only to be told to collect the car in four hours time  given the absence of customers and the information on the website i explained that i was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if i did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which i agreed would probably be for the best  i spoke to  about this and  while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price  they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged  i felt like a second class customer for using  in penicuik  if the conditions were made plain on the website  i would have been able to make a different choice  worse was the fact that  customer relations were not interested in addressing what i think is a real issue incidentally i did not bother with the discount as i was delighted with the service i received in peebles 
8678,[7],ease of ordering and convenience of locality of garages for fitting

8694,[9],let down so badly - i wish i did not have to give this review even 1 star as they are not worth it they emailed me at 17 17 last night saying they could not fit my tires the following day as already arranged    i was traveling 5000 miles round trip the following day and my tires would become illegal during that time so urgently needed them done they never responded to my email and i was on hold in a phone que for 35 minutes  got put through to escaltion team who took another 10 minutes to answer the only thing that was reasonable was the manner in which the complaint team approached the complaint however the best they could do is offer a refund plus £30 and a 10% discount on future purchases  the extra £30 did not even cover the additional costs that i incurred but at least they were polite and sypathetic and agreed to feed back that a phone call so late in the day would have been appropriate to give me some options   now trying to find new tyres  instead of doing all the other things i had planned for today in prepartion for travelling abroad disgusting for such a big company to leave me stranded like this

8766,"[4, 9]",i've only given this 5 stars because of the fantastic service phil provided i had new tyres fitted a couple of saturday's ago  four days before my mot and service noticed on the sunday that the tpms fault light was on which would be an mot failure went back when they opened on monday and was told the light was off when the tyres had been fitted  i couldn't take a pressure reading so something was affecting the valve  the valve was fiddled with and i was told to come back the next day when phil was there contacted  cs and was told i'd get a quick callback however all i got was an email on the tuesday with all the reasons why a tpms might fail and to go to the garage on returning on tuesday phil was there  straight away removed the tyre  and it was clear the tpms must have been damaged during the fitting and then shearing whilst driving at motorway speeds  he couldn't be more apologetic and arranged for their mobile fitter to come out and fit a new sensor all in all fantastic service and saved the day 
8767,[9],tyres were ordered and appointment made with the garage for fitting  text received to remind us that morning  however by the time we reached the garage the appointment had been cancelled as the wrong tyres had been sent  no text to inform us   informed us there had been an error and would give us a £20 refund as a good will gesture  we rebooked for later that week but as yet no refund  very poor experience
8768,"[4, 11]",the company broke my tyre sensor when fitting the tyres  the garage refused to even consider they had caused the damage and did not offer to look at it even though it broke within miles of the tyres being changed  i had to use another garage  and incur an addition fee  to fix the tyres as well as not being able to drive the car  they found the issue quickly and confirmed my tyre sensor had been broken when the tyres were fitted by the previous garage  i would avoid at all cost and look elsewhere  the slightly cheaper tyres is not worth you car being broken and hassle to fix it

8902,"[4, 6]",it's not the first time i have used these guys and again fantastic i drive a big lexus ls and to have all five tyres changed for £411 00 is a great price the tyres i chose have better braking distance than some of the so called better names at half the price so i am very happy thsnk you  
8903,[9],offered me dates and a garage which i accepted  then they changed the dates and garage when i eventually arrived at the garage for fitting  the garage wasnt sure if the tyres had been delivered which led to a further wait  the garage did a good job but constantly moaned about  com and i had to agree with them  as  were pretty much crap and it would have been so much easier to just book direct with the garage   said i didnt give then enough notice to arrange fitting at my chosen garage  i gave them 4 days  had i gone direct to the garage i only had to give a days notice    you were rubbish

8908,[2],website easy to use  nominated garage near & very good
8909,[11],i have used  for years and would recommend it  you could probably save a few pounds if you hunted around and went out of your way - but for a simple  reliable service at a competitive price and with a wide choice  they can't be beaten  makes a drudge task very straightforward 
8910,"[3, 9]",good prices  great selections  lots of fitting places to chose  but make sure you know the fitting place before booking as some offer bad/poor services  time to delivery the tyre or fitting could be improved  waiting 2 days for the tyre/fitting

8917,[9],firstly i had no email to tell me when my tyres were dispatched  they didn't appear on the date specified  i called support staff a total of 5 times to chase up because i was promised call backs   they didn't happen  it's not fair to treat customers that way  we need to be reassured you're on the case then we'll confidently buy from you again 
8918,[9],i ordered two tyres initially on bank holiday monday then the following day it was decided another two would be a good idea overnight the price increased by £4 a tyre  not a lot but not appreciated the fitters  in the village where i live  as usual were very good 
8919,"[3, 4, 11]", offered a great price for the product i wanted  unfortunately i was let down by the garage i picked to fit the tyres  i will use  again but not that garage in swardeston

8927,[4],worked a treat 
8928,"[4, 9]",there was a delay in delivery to the fitters which was notified in advance and luckily not a problem my slight annoyance is that normally i would expect to receive the same batch of tyres for each axle  however the age marking on the rear axle shows one was fairly new and the other around 18 months old

8940,[9],i have used this company several times mainly because if their competitive prices  however once i have ordered my tyres and paid for them and booked my fitting time i believe that all is good   however as has happened today for my fitting tomorrow i have just had a cancellation email as the tyres haven’t been sent to the garage this seems to be a common problem going by other reviews so my question is how can they be so incompetent  it should be simple   customer orders tyres  they should be delivered to relevant garage to be fitted   simple  but once again they have failed me  other issues i’ve previously had were booked into a garage for a saturday appointment when the garage didn’t open on a saturday and another appointment was cancelled because they didn’t have enough fitters 
8941,[4],garages who fit the tyres don't know what there doing

8962,[4],overall  i received a good  no frills service by having the worn front tyres replaced on my toyota  unfortunately  they weren't able to go the 'extra mile' for me when i asked the receptionist at the time whether the partially worn rears  could be swapped with the new fronts  this was not granted as there wasn't a four poster ramp available  not so sure i'll go back there as previous garages i've used  have always undertaken this cost saving work for me

9005,[9],no problems other than a slow response to a request for an appointment change
9006,[2],excellent - a very good selection of services to choose from at  
9007,[9],awful experience chose this provider as believed it was a fast and easy choice however i found myself without a car for over 1 week with 3 separate appointments made for tyre installation as they kept having “issues” with with delivering them on time customer service was poor and an all over disappointing service

9017,[4],my local garage that services my car pointed out both my front tyres had worn badly on the inside edge's  they mentioned they were approved  tyre fitters   had special offer on the new all weather michelin tyres  so no brained  all went swimminglyy  ordered  delivered and fitted 
9018,"[9, 11]",very easy to use  cheaper than direct with garage  keep you informed when garage make errors /double book etc
9019,[4],excellent price service  recently bought 2 new tires from  com & was very pleased with the price which was much cheaper than i could find any where else  gave several places for the fitting service near me which was done as soon as we arrived & back on the road within 25 minutes  only issue we had was that the tire pressure warning light was on after fitting  they said it will go out when i start driving but it did not  stopped at a petrol station & found the new tires were well below the correct pressure  perhaps if they are not sure of the pressure then they should ask the customer  not a big issue & easily resolved  highly recommend & wont hesitate to look there when i need anymore tires

9028,"[2, 4, 11]","very wide range of tyres  always seem to have in stock the particular ones i'm seeking  their ""premier garage"" i use for fitting always takes special care of my sports car "

9154,[4],"the whole process went like clockwork  the only slight concern i have  is that prior to the new tyres having been fitted  there were no problems with my steering wheel  having had the new tyres  when i reached 70mph on the motorway  i had steering wheel vibration  i assumed that there needed to be an adjustment with the balancing  i rang up and arranged to take the car back with no problems  ""tommy""went to check the off side front wheel first  and then changed his mind and did the near side  it was slightly out  he then did the off side and immediately he put the wheel on the balancing machine  he said the wheel was buckled and there was nothing he could do  he showed me the buckle and asked if i had hit a pot hole   it was almost as if he knew what he was going to find  somehow  it did not add up and i am now having to get the wheel straightened or at worst  get a new one "

9231,[4],"very good service  although not too keen on being called ""love"" all the time and having my back patted the tyres were as ordered  and all four were replaced in one hour what a pity swan garage has to endure that ghastly car park price wise - excellent "

9254,"[4, 11]",garage service wonderful  price competitive but review is only 3 stars mainly because the 2 4x4 tyres that i had fitted were actually manufactured four years ago  so the cheaper price was all down to the tyres being old stock  although the tyre is classed as usable and can be sold and fitted up to 5 years from manufacture  if i had known beforehand the age of the tyres supplied i would have shopped elsewhere  disappointed 
9255,"[0, 4]",quick and very easy tyre replacement

9261,"[0, 8]",fantastic and incredibly efficient in addition to saving over forty quid
9262,"[4, 9]",booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as i wanted to keep the tyres already on the car  the first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time  this was very frustrating as i wanted the new tyres for a road trip i was taking to scotland  we arranged to have the tyres fitted the following saturday am  at 11 o'clock that morning i received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from   and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead   i said yes  the next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and i received no call whatsoever  i called them at around 4:45pm  they said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening  i spoke to  who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following saturday  i asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as i didn't trust them but they did  the following saturday arrived and once again  no one showed  i called  who called the tyre fitters  once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on sunday again instead  obviously i told them where to go  in the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this saturday  i went there and all appeared well  however when i collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off  the tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame  they said they will have a look at it this friday  it's fair to say i have now given in  to be fair  throughout this whole situation   customer service has actually been very good  especially from their call centre staff  and they have compensated me at each missed appointment  the problem is that there is a big issue with the tyre fitters they use/in general and i would not recommend whatsoever  having your tyres mobile fitted in the leeds/bradford area as this is the only mobile tyre fitter  use

9302,[6],no problems throughout
9303,[9],my original chosen time/date couldn’t be honoured because only one of my two tyres were delivered my second time/date couldn’t be honoured because they did not have the 2nd tire in stock so i was offered another tyre make and a new fitting date  on the plus side they did kept me updated after the initial appointment 
9304,"[10, 11]",quick  easy and good price able to use a tyre garage that i had used before

9308,[8],an excellent service with friendly staff  offered coffee and biscuit while i waited for the tyres to be fitted 
9309,"[4, 9]",not a great experience so far  still waiting for a missing tyre from my order  it seems “chat” to a team member actually means send an e-mail    not quite the same thing  no replies from that as yet help line merrily racks up a premium cost whilst you wait    i bailed out just after 5 mins before it cost me any more money i feel very isolated as a customer with an issue right now when things go wrong  don’t appear to meet the standards of customer care that we have come to expect from a major online retailer  particularly one owned by a company as reputable as michelin 
9310,[9],great tyres at competitive price would have scored five stars  but  it looks as though the front tyres will need rebalancing i‚äôve used  before and are my preferred choice

9312,[3],everything advertised was done excellent service
9313,"[4, 9]",the purchase of the tyres was easy and simple and the tyres i choose were a good price however  the garage for the fitting was not good  the original booking was cancelled then booked again and that was cancelled then had to wait 2 weeks to get a date when i wasn't working and they could fit the tyres  when we actually went to get them done the garage was very quiet and kindly didn't inflate one of the tyres correctly so that evening when driving the car i had t ore inflate one of them to the correct pressure  garage bad  tyres good 
9314,[9],very responsive customer service  gave me a full refund when i cancelled my order 
9315,"[1, 8]",great job very prompt
9316,[11],i found ordering tyres very easy from start to finish  a great range of tyres were available at extremely competitive prices which included fitting and at a date at a garage of my choice  couldn't ask for anything more 
9317,[10],good service

9319,[9],first time using  i was suppose to have my tyre fitted on the fiday i get a email to say they will not be fitted friday as my tyres did not turn up on time  then they email me friday afternoon to telle my tyres have finally tirn up amd to call then so i ring  on friday night the lady told me that she will sort my tyres out and phone the garage saturday as soon as it open at 10am to see when i could have my tyres fitted then phone me to tell me as soon as she know a time and day but she's never ring me back so i waited till tuesday still no call from balck circle so on wednesday i phone the garage myself and finally got a booking to have my tyres fitted i was not happy with this service
9320,"[8, 11]",i bought two tyres for my t4 and saved £30  process online worked well and efficiently  the service at the garage was real fast and prompt though the staff could do with some customer training  overall very happy 
9321,[8],friendly staff   very helpful    
9322,"[1, 2, 9]",very straightforward website and good customer service when the appointment didn’t quite go to plan
9323,"[9, 11]",the booking process was simple and choosing a local garage for a specific time slot felt like a ‘win win’ situation however  i don’t think an hour to fit two new tyres is acceptable  with no apology or explanation  it appeared that this is the ‘norm’ for bookings made via a third party site like  and not directly with the garage themselves - can’t say they seemed happy to receive the additional business  so why sign up to this scheme   i need two more tyres soon  but as the savings are not that great i’ll book direct at my usual fitter  so at least i know it will take half the time - i can’t even say it was a lack of fitters as there were at least 3  i’d say a lesson learned the hard way  which is a shame as it seemed like a good idea at the time  but the customer service was let down by the garage 
9324,[11],after discovering '' i wouldn't go anywhere else
9325,"[4, 8]",no issues  everything was to a standard i would hope for when dealing with a member of the public 
9326,"[2, 9]",have used  before and like the service i like the ability to review a wide range of tyre choices on the website before making my choice rather than the limited selection you would get at a garage  then you can book your time slot and place to have the tyres fitted  the fitters have always been very good too will definitely use again 
9327,[11],got the tyres i wanted at a competitive price with no hassle having them fitted  😊
9328,"[6, 7]",needed tyres  ordered them and within a couple of days had them on my car what more do you want easy does it  no fuss will use service again xxx
9329,[11],two words just about sum it up    the best
9330,"[2, 10]",excellent web site  easy to arrange and good prices
9331,"[2, 9]",this was a simple  fuss-free system to use  i found a wide variety of tyre options to choose with many locations to choose from at a date and time of my choice too which is great the service delivery on the day was professional  i was given a full checklist to keep as well which is handy the customer service team emailed with confirmations of my booking as assisted with a time change a faultless service experience 
9332,"[1, 9]",easy to book on line great customer service when i had to call them  service at the centre could be better actual work carried out was fine but customer service could be better by fitters 
9333,"[2, 6]", com was recommended to me by my brother  so i decided to give them a try  the pricing was very competitive and the service provided by my local tyre fitter was very good too  i will definitely be using them again 
9334,"[6, 8, 9]",on time service and did everything as agreed
9335,[7],great service  i just picked my choice of tyres and got a great 15% discount  i then chose a great affiliate garage 2 miles away and the job was done in half hour  i was able to choose the slot most suitable for me too  very satisfied indeed  i also had lots of choice of tyres to choose from at good prices 
9336,"[2, 10]",good selection of tyres; good prices; recommended a great local shop for fitting
9337,[4],rotella rh01 fitted on mg zs  good rating with pleasing performance at budget end price  well fitted and balanced by gilmar motor engineers in molesey  first try of  com seems a good experience 
9338,"[8, 9]",2nd time i've had tyres fitted here and the service is friendly and professional 
9339,"[1, 6]",great service and easy to use  definitely recommend 
9340,[9],used many times before but never again  ordered my tyres and selected my fitting date  got an email to delay fitting date by 4 days because they claimed they couldn't get the tyres in that time  arrived at selected garage on rearranged day and time and tyres hadn't arrived  rang customer services and was told that the tyres were on the van and would be delivered later that day sometime  fitting garage said they can get the tyres for the following day so i cancelled the  order and told the garage to order them in  they were paid for the tyres almost a week earlier but told me a refund would take 3-5 days  told them this wasn't acceptable and the refund must be made that day  tyres were fitted mid-day the following day and was told that the  tyres were delivered at the same time as the ones they ordered  i paid a 2% premium to get the tyres from a local garage but only pay when the job is finished  no brainer 
9341,"[2, 11]",excellent prices and availability of local fitters  have used before and will use again; my tyre supplier of choice  
9342,[10],good service and job well done 
9343,[6],great service  knowledge and sound advice given for the future  will always use this company 
9344,[4],i initially reviewed  at one star for the absolutely dismal service and treatment i received from ats cannock  i can honestly say where ats failed    com have stepped up  their customer service is fantastic  hopefully  on a normal transaction you'll have little to do with  com as you'll purchase through their website and hand everything over to your chosen garage  however  should you have any issues   com customer service will exceed anything offered from a garage and adds a layer of protection  i honestly will never buy tyres again without using  com  this experience has taught me things can go very wrong very quickly and although i hope this experience will not be repeated  i'll always feel much better knowing  com are there to help 
9345,"[2, 7]",easy to use their site and arrange for tyres to be fitted at a local garage very pleased and will use them again
9346,"[4, 9]",early days but the tyres appear ok  my concern was that they were delivered to the fitting garage squashed  the tyre fitter had great difficulty fitting and inflating them  their blasting machine was broken so they had to get one from somewhere else  finally fitted after 3 hours  fitting should have been around 1 hour 
9347,[8],smooth transaction and efficient service  highly recommended 
9348,[11],if like me  you are contemplating buying tyres online  but are a little unsure  i can recommend   from choosing the tyres i wanted  at a very good price  to having them fitted at a local garage  the whole process was very easy and efficient  i will certainly be using them again 
9349,"[7, 8]",faultless service from ordering to fitting would recommend them to everyone 
9350,"[4, 11]",i had a good experience with  - they had the best price for what i wanted and their fitting centre was local  i did offer the centre the work directly but the could not come near the price  which was a bit sad for me  i wonder whether they get enough from their links to   i expect that this sort of service will see many a small tyre retailer leave the market place 
9351,[9],well priced and the lady in the office was brilliant trying to accommodate my requested time for fitting  ats were also excellent

9371,[9],excellent service and the garage was fantastic as well  five stars *****i have a friend who has a friend who works in a garage and he couldn't beet the price 
9372,[4],i have previously used  a few years ago with no problems so decided to use them again  booking 4 new tyres for my audi q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘recommended’ garage  so far so good so turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “the car wash is outside”  after pointing out i was there for 4 new tyres was told “oh sorry” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay  so not the greeting i would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing  their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38   after the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking  and the special price of £38  so declined           call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking  seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £38 out of people so after approx 1hr 15 mins i left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up  4 days & less that 75 miles later i got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the f/n/s wheel has a nut missing  the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the f/o/s wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers i immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced but as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now i have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover  the managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should i settle for second bast  my car was in purse to condition when i went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy  overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and i would never use them again  come on  this garage is doing you a disservice sort it out

9398,[4]," ok mcconechys not ok  ordered up my new tyres from  online  good price and good prompt service from   however  i made a massive mistake in choosing mcconechy's  sighthill  edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters  it is clear that as a  customer and not an actual mcconechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted  you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way mcconechy's fitted my tyres  upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go  i walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted  i then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork a day later i was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that mcconechy's had not even changed the valve stems either  i contacted mcconechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone  i told him that i noticed they had not changed the valve stems  i got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think i would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted  so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but i changed the valve cores though"" i don't believe a word of that  what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know  is that i'm a fully qualified engineer and i know corner cutting when i see it  remember i had to actually request that they fit dustcaps  unfortunately i didn't notice mcconechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or i would have pulled them up right there and then i know why he didn't change the valve stems  it is because they are all rusted up  badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over  maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his bs story about them being metal i paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted  that is not what i got i got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that i don't believe about the valve cores being changed but that makes it ok doesn't it   no  it certainly doesn't  also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm  well when i checked them 50 miles later  the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels  the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far i do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place  more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun  there is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench  the mcconechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter  avoid them  you are not a mcconechy's customer  you are an annoyance to them  you are getting in their way  not at all happy with any of this steven dryden "

9761,"[6, 11]",it was my first time buying online tyres  but i have to admit that this online shop surprised me in good way with the prices and the customer service  truly recommend them 
9762,[11],got tyres             
9763,[9],i ordered my tyres on a monday evening to be fitted on wednesday only to get told they couldn’t do it  speaking to the local garage he said they were never going to be fitted for the day i had booked for  it was then booked for the following monday only to be cancelled again  only an email to the ceo sorted it out to be fitted on the monday  will be using tyres on the drive from now on 
9764,[9],i found the staff at bc com very polite and helpful and bc themselves were/are one of the cheapest online tyre suppliers  my gripe though concerns the fact that having ordered and paid online for 5 tyres for my land-rover  when the day came for them to be fitted i had rung up the previous afternoon to be told they didn’t have the tyres so the fitting wouldn’t take place  as it was a home fitting i’d taken the day off    i was then told they could get four of the tyres for me by the following tuesday and the fifth by the friday  great thought i well  i got my four tyres fitted on the tuesday  no problem thursday afternoon came at at about 5 30pm i got an email from bc stating they couldn’t get my 5th tyre and “how did i want to proceed” livid     just a tad i called bc but by then they’d closed for the day  so rang first thing the next day  very helpful and polite lady understood my frustrations but went on to tell me that the tyre i’d ordered  paid for and expected to be fitted that morning couldn’t be obtained and bc didn’t know when they’d get some in  great   bottom line is a tyre was sourced   and was eventually fitted the following wednesday  three weeks this took to complete my advice would be make sure bc either have or can immediately source the tyres you’ after before committing to the deal 
9765,[4],great system  makes things dead easy as i have a bmw with run flats
9766,[3],good tyre choice at a fair price 
9767,[9],arrived at garage to be informed that you had sent one correct tyre long with no incorrectly sized tyre  the problem was further exaggerated by  making a other appointment without consultation with me for 4 days later when i was due to be away  i therefore had to cancel the transaction and try to locate tyres elsewhere through my local garage they did mange his with lot of phone calls  the one positive was that the tyres eventually procured were in fact cheaper than through   so if anyone is reading this please ring around your local dealers before committing yourself 
9768,"[0, 11]",quick to get fitted and saved money even tho same garage fitted them
9769,[9],used them lots of times  i guess the fitting location and time of day makes a difference  if busy you may have to plan going somewhere whilst the tyres are fitted but i choose mid week  so far  very good prices and plenty of reminders about the appointment 
9770,"[9, 11]",discount codesi had a previous bad experience with  fitting service via ats  bc gave me a discount code for use on a future order  however when i came to order my next tyres there was a promotion for buying two tyres which i was able to take advantage of  however  the bc system is unable to process two discount codes therefore making my previous discount useless ats aylesford still needed over an hour to fit two tyres i will not use them again

9837,[6],i have used this garage on multiple occasions  the promptness and level of service are second to none  thoroughly recommended 
9838,[9],i booked an available appointment from the options provided  which was then unilaterally rebooked for an inconvenient time  by the time i was able to talk to someone at   it was too late to rebook for the day i needed  i had to cancel the appointment and find a different source of tyres at short notice

9858,[11],all worked well 
9859,[4],couldn’t really fault them  staff were courteous and polite  the only possible downside if i’m being hyper-critical is the customer waiting area at the branch i had my tyres renewed wasn’t exactly the savoy  and there was no viewing window to the bay to watch them working on your car  as an engineer myself  i like to view these things going on 
9860,[9],have used   a few times for tyres  they are hard to beat  however i have found if you are booking other services  it’s not as seamless as tyre bookings  my car needed a service and mot  the garage didn’t get the instruction through in enough time  so my service and mot were a week apart  you have a good set up it just needs a bit of refinement where other services are required besides tyres

9892,[4],well satisfied with the service  had two new tyres fitted to the front and all seemed ok  the only problem was when i travelled on a dual carriageway  three days later  at 70mph my cars warning system lit up and informed me to check my tyre pressures  i checked them and there was a difference of 3 psi between the fitted tyres  thought i must have a slow puncture but since inflation i have checked and all seems ok 
9893,"[9, 10]",good service started job right on my appointment time 
9894,[4],choosing and getting new tyres fitted has never been so easy 
9895,[5],top class service along with the best price i could find will use again
9896,"[1, 8]",great service- exactly as promised
9897,[8],very good service from and also east bilney garage highly recommend them 
9898,[9],wrong tyres showed up  so couldn’t be fitted  was offered a £40 refund for inconvenience which i accepted but still hasn’t been credited to my account  filled out customer service questionnaire and requested call back  still haven’t received a call back  not impressed with the customer service at all  i shan’t be using again tyres are just a good value from my local garage
9899,[3],good product as specified 
9900,[10],good service 👌🏼
9901,"[4, 9]",the price was ok the fitters were great no issues great guys but  failed to deliver the same tires and instead sent two different ones it then took a further 4 days and two trips to the garage and they thought 10% off my next order was an ok compensation i would say that plus a 10% refund for wasted time and petroltires are great much quieter on the road
9902,"[2, 6]",great price  easy to use  will definitely use again 
9903,[4],wheels not balanced properly am taking car back this morning 
9904,"[0, 7]",easy to order and good value 
9905,"[6, 11]",we have now used  twice  both times it was so easy and cheaper than elsewhere  we even found a very local garage on the website to do the work  will definitely use again when the time comes 
9906,"[1, 8]",very good service and great price range of tyres very helpful staff and everything went as planned will use them again 
9907,[9],unfortunately rated only as 3 star as they failed to deliver my tyres to the garage on time meaning i wasted time going twice  shame as previously been great service
9908,"[4, 7]",really good ordering process  few issues with dates and resolved wrong size ordering so very happy overall 
9909,[8],very easy and efficient  will recommend to all i speak to 
9910,[6],very good service and would use them again
9911,"[0, 7, 11]",a simple online process  great value tyres and straightforward way of choosing the local garage  will use again 
9912,"[2, 4]",the website was so easy to use and i managed to find a local garage to fit a new tyre for a very competitive price  i was very relieved as other tyre companies couldn’t even find a tyre to fit as the car was a 2019 number plate   when they did i had to wait a week for a tyre to be delivered  not good when you have only 3 useable tyres   the garage i went to next day were friendly and really good  the receptionist was so welcoming and even made me a cup of tea while i waited  will definitely use them again and 
9913,[4],  i cannot fault  my only issue is with the fitting garage  why they cannot put the correct tyre pressures when fitting my new tyres  they put them 4psi too low  this is 10% lower they are supposed to be set at  is this not a safety issue  the info is shown on the fuel flap  it's not difficult  or they should have asked me the question  they are supposed to be the experts not me 
9914,[11],extremely impressed with the tyre quality  price was unbeatable and fitted for free at a garage near by  beats commercial mainstreet tyre outlets that try to find half a dozen other things that need doing when you havent even asked them  have used  before and woulnt even bother with anyone else  highly recommended 
9915,[4],i bought my tyres individually due to cost but the second tyre that arrived tooled to have been fitted before i got it it had the soap on the rim of tyre and looked scuffed round the edge i’ve just took it now to be fitted and the fitted said the same but as a service the service was easy fast delivery and cheaper than the rest cheers
9916,[1],as a returning customer once again a very professional and profitable purchase   a1 service as usual
9917,[6],we have used  for tyres over the last few years and have no complaints  service is defo 5 ⭐️  😁
9918,[6],very pleased with the service with  also very happy with the price of our tyres and none but least the guy at the service point were ever so helpful and pleasant well done guy will have no hesitation to use you again one happy customer thanks again
9919,[4],good work and my car was washed and hovered out when i picked it up 
9920,[4],very much satisfied
9921,"[1, 5]",great service  found everything i needed at the right price 
9922,"[4, 9]","the only problem i had which was new to me was the tyre fit  i'm not sure it was prominent enough on the website and i'm not sure what difference it makes  but i originally ordered a mercedes fit tyre for my jag and i had to re-order and wait some time  it might be advisable if a check could be made for a car make & tyre match where ""fit"" is important "
9923,[11],everything went well with no glitches  thank you
9924,[9],have used  in the past with no problems     however this time my tyres were delayed by a week from promised fitting date this meant that i had to reschedule appointments arrange lifts - causing unnecessary extra organisation probably will not use them again  
9925,[11],i have used  to put tyres on my car on two occasions now and i have found the process to be efficient and most importantly it saves you money  sames tyres - cheaper price 
9926,[1],excellent efficient service
9927,"[2, 11]",my fourth time with  and i have no hesitation in recommending them  ease of use of site to order and fund fitting centre to suit you  good prices; cheaper than anything else i have found by some way 
9928,"[4, 11]",just a great way to buy tyres  ordered 2 avon’s last year  got a split in the sidewall so check the website to find they were still available at the same price used a great local garage who have a collection of classic magazines while you wait  perfect
9929,[9],very good  only negative was i had a date booked and they had to delay due to not having the tyre in stock  so had to go on spare for a week and a half 
9930,[10],great price and very good service
9931,[9],failed to supply tyres  when asked for a refund i was told i had to wait

9933,"[1, 6]",fantastic service and prices    have used them before      excellent service      no need to go anywhere else 
9934,[5],top service 👍
9935,[9],tyres were late  fitting had to be rescheduled 
9936,"[4, 9]",my first experience was great really straight forward fitter was really friendly  i did not hesitate to go back for my next purchase  unfortunately the fitter i had used before was busy so i chose another local one all seemed great then i get an email informing me my chosen fitter is unable to accomodate my tyre size  fine but if so they really should remove them as an option when you buy that size tyre i was offered another fitter further away probably the only one available that day but i did not wish to drive too far with a tyre that could deflate at any time  i tried to decline the suggestion but this was ignored and the booking made  i did not have the time whilst working to be messed about i gave up and requested a refund i had time off the following week so i decided to try once more to get the tyres sorted only to be misled by the search engine metadata and my own eagerness for a bargain  i was in too much of a hurry and thought i had finally found a real bargain  i did not check properly and i bought a smaller size 18 inch instead of 19 inch i noticed as soon as i got the confirmation email and sent an email requesting the size change and to cancel the fitting date  obviously i would have to pay the difference an email arrived confirming the fitting time so i sent another email requesting contact  5 hours later i got another email the email informed me i wanted to change the tyres i had already bought to the same ones really  why on earth would anyone want that  again they are not reading emails  i responded correcting the mistake the following day i had heard nothing regarding the change and the appointment was due that day  i then received a text informing me my appointment was due in 30 minutes i sent another email asking for urgent contact hours later still nothing i then spent around ten minutes on hold only to be politely informed that someone would phone me back in a few hours they did as promised phone me back and finally i got a person who listened  i explained my mistake she quickly sorted it explained the extra cost and booked the day and time for me the fitter mckinnon motors was great again really quick and courteous it is such a shame a hassle free way of getting a good deal on tyres is marred by poor communication skills when it works it really works  when something goes wrong it can be a challenge 
9937,"[4, 8]",absolutely excellent service  noticed i'd ordered the wrong tyre for my car and emailed me straight away  was easily rectified by phone  garage faultless  highly recommend
9938,[8],friendly and helpful staff

9944,[6],very pleased with the service received  efficient and courteous and helpful to my husband who is disabled  would certainly use them again 
9945,"[2, 9]",the website is informative and easy to use  my chosen tyre fitters texted me to confirm the appointment and were ready when i arrived  the job was done quickly and efficiently  i have no complaints 
9946,[7],it was so easy to order the tyres and arrange fitting of them
9947,"[1, 9]",overall good service  had to contact as didn’t recieve confirmation on tyre booking but dealt with promptly and well when phoned up customer service team
9948,[0],very quick and easy and good value for money  very friendly
9949,"[0, 11]",a great help made the procedure very simple & i recieved a great deal
9950,[4],i drove into a screwdriver which lodged itself on my back tyre  it caused slow but certain deflation  i needed a fast and reliable service at a convenient to replace the tyre  i used  com services and i was pleased with the overall service 
9951,[11],brilliant no hassle and no hidden extras 
9952,"[1, 9]",easy on line booking  great customer service on the day  quality work completed during the given time slot  no hanging about 
9953,[9],up to now my experience had been excellent  however my recent experience of customer service was poor  i ordered tyres on friday and although the monday was a bank holiday i expected the tyres to be fitted on tuesday am which i had been told would be the earliest which was fine  however tuesday came and i had not received a fitting slot  i phoned the garage and they agreed to fit them as long as i could get there b4 9 30 i did and the job was done by 11 15 the garage came good 
9954,"[4, 8]",what a fantastic service i would recommend this service to all it was so easy the garage that i went to was superb they were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble having just moved to the area it was so refreshing to receive such a high level of customer care
9955,[8],very helpful and friendly- will using and recommending these guys
9956,"[4, 11]",service works mainly as expected  for any extras like tpms valves  price is fixed by the fitter and not known until tyres are being fitted price could better  i probably suffer because michelin own  and i always buy michelins 
9957,"[0, 8]",quick and easy service and the garage they recommended was fantastic 
9958,"[0, 11]",so far great value tyres  will be buying again
9959,[4],the tyres were fitted at one of your centres   where we were treated with indifference  as though we were being nuisances for being there  we did not receive an invoice  the valve dust caps were not refitted after the new tyres had been fitted  shockingly  the workmanship was downright dangerous as the wheel nuts on both wheels had not been tightened  i was able to remove them with my fingers after checking for a clonking noise from the front of the car which turned out to be caused by the wheels moving on the studs due to the wheel nuts coming undone 
9960,[9],cant fault  but pick you fitter carefully as jeffreys tyres in warrington who i picked were poor  i booked an am appointment via the  sit and duly turned up around 9 am to be told they couldn't even look at it until 12 and was asked to leave my car with them  i said i booked am and was told they dont do appointments  do i sail i will return at 12 and was again told they dont do appointments  their fitting bay at this point had 1 car in and nobody waiting and their own website takes appointments  ive used them for 20 years but never again  i will book through bc though and choose another fitter
9961,"[4, 9]",i was advised to arrive at garage early on a first come first serve basis  i arrived at 8am  unfortunately this was not the case on arrival as garage advised that my time schedule was 9 30  so had to hang around for 2 hours ☹️  mixed instruction which could have been clearer 🤔
9962,"[4, 9]",price was great and very convinient having a time slot but the service was poor  there was debate over whether it could be done because there was a small amount of snow on the ground and they were having a problem getting cars on the ramp  this station is located in a petrol station so no shortage of grit etc so seemed a bit silly that they were making such a fuss  they were also very slow and swore a lot whilst doing the work which seemed unnecessary 
9963,[6],first class service and price 
9964,[9],first appointment was cancelled as weren‚äôt delivered in time  second appointment  i waited and hour before they told me only one tyre had been delivered  had to be away from the office for a third day to finally get the other tyre fitted  would not recommend 
9965,"[10, 11]",good price and all went smoothly

9972,"[1, 9, 11]",terrific idea & execution 
9973,[11],was really impressed with how easy it was to deal with   the hardest part was having to go outside in the cold to find my tyre size  picked the tyers i wanted and a time that suited and now i have new tyers  easy as that  will definitely use again  thanks
9974,"[0, 1]",spot on great service and excellent value 
9975,[9],i would be happy to recommend  com to purchase tyres  i'm far less happy with the garage they sent me to  to have the tyres fitted  i asked this garage to perform an oil change at the same time which they did  however over 400 miles later the electronics in my car are still telling me i need an oil change  so 5 stars for  and only 2 stars for their chosen garage  😕
9976,[3],very quick and quality service

9992,"[4, 9]","this is not a review of  com as such but my experience of the garage booked through them  a terrible experience meaning i will never use a&s mot ltd again  details of the issues are below - arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4-wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside- took time off work and waited at garage  work done and was given paperwork  wheels dirty - but as expected- left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- got to work and checked values on paperwork  rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- left work early and returned to garage  told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- rang audi to ask about part required etc  and was told that all settings are adjustable by any competent garage  both front and rear- went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm  they put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc - took more time off work to return to a&s as agreed  told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- when finished told ""all done"" - given no paperwork  asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there  rear still not adjusted- asked for an explanation  wasn't given one but told i would need to bring it back again- i then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me  i checked the dash cam  found out it had been moved to point at the sky  reviewed the footage and it was an employee at a&s that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - i can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one  was also stuck on like glue  took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfin summary  don’t use this garage if you value your vehicle  time  money or safety "

10033,"[2, 11]",i have purchased several tyres now from  and find the whole experience so easy and straightforward choosing tyres on the website is great as you can all the relevant information as it is easily laid out and provides technical details such as noise levels  which is important  depending on one's budget - simplicity itself 
10034,[1],great customer service very happy good mechanical work 👍😃
10035,[9],don't bother booking online  none of the garages update availability and  don't really care 
10036,[11],its nice to be able to buy tyres online that are not normally stocked at your local shop and have a massive choice of budget and quality tyres companies like ats when i enquired about the type of pirelli i was after said it wasn't available to them but a search on  showed four different types in that make i had a choice of day and time i could get them fitted without waiting to long

10043,[9],absolutely useless have possibly the worst booking system i’ve ever come across  i selected a local garage on saturday 23 march at 9am and received confirmation of this appointment  when i arrived at the garage  at the booked date and time  the garage told me my appointment was for 10am the day before  cut a long story short  the garage told  they were unable to fit me in at 9am on sat 23 march  but they could do 10am on fri 22 march  that’s fine  however  neglected to inform me of this and i had to rearrange my entire weekend plans  the garage was able to fit me in on the sunday morning  however myself  my daughter and my parents had to change our entire weekend plans to accommodate this  also  my wife bought a tyre through the  website  using the correct reference details and  sent the wrong tyre to the garage  my wife has now had to wait a week for  to issue the correct tyre and the garage to have the availability to fit her in i would not use or recommend  to anyone  the only reason i gave them one star was because the website would not allow me to complete this review without selecting at least one star 
10044,"[5, 7]",very easy & simple to use - everything worked as expected & with no issues whatsoever  great to be able to choose the most convenient fitter  will definitely use again

10063,"[4, 11]",i bought two tyres not top grade and used one of  fitters in paisley maconachie in well st paisley  it all went well the young fitter did a good job no extras   even took out the scrapes on the rimthe tyres look good   were good value and much cheaper than other suppliers very happy with the overall service both the tyres and the fitting 
10064,[4],i’ve bought dozens of michelin tyres from costco  but on this occasion i just wanted some mid-range tyres for 20yr old  volvo v70 t5 that we keep sentimentally along with the other car that my dad owned when he died 5yrs ago  chose kumho’s as i’d bought a 2nd hand bmw with these on a few years ago and they seemed ok  existing avon ) only 20% worn / 2 years old  but showing extensive micro-cracking to sidewalls   responded to customer satisfaction email from  commenting that jobsheet disclosed that fitters has seriously over-torqued wheelnuts   suggesting they might want to look at their qc/spec  on this  by the time i got a response  requesting a copy of the jobsheet  it had become clear that one of the fitted tyres was not holding pressure  so advised this additionally  when sending copy jobsheet invited to return to fitting depot to rectify  unfortunately  return visit was an absolute object lesson in how not to deal with a customer service issue  particularly in a business where the customers need to be assured of the professionalism of the service with which they are being provided  not least because it impacts directly on their safety so:-  don’t moan to me as soon as i arrive that you’ve “been dealing with nothing but problems all day ”  i don’t care  i just want you to do what should have done properly with my car in the first place -  crack the wheel nuts off with the tyre on the ground  not against the auto gearbox-“park”  this is car diy  page 1  unbelievable -  don’t tell me that “often old cars leak from the rims”  inferring there’s nothing to be done in that case  i drove more than a million miles a bought maybe a hundred tyres before you were even born sonny and know perfectly well that there will often be slight corrosion on the bead seat of even a very new alloy wheel  and this is capable of compromising the integrity of the air seal  any tyre fitter who knows his salt will inspect the rim  note this  and  as necessary  wire brush or even file this smooth -  when faced with my sceptical look about “leaky rims”  don’t then pathetically backtrack and suggest kerbing  or a pothole as the culprit  the rim was not inspected and properly prepared for fitting and that’s all there is to it  -  tighten the wheenuts down in a star pattern  not a circle  and do the same with each of the nuts  just because there are 5  you don’t have to forget to torque down the 5th  i watched you  -  having been told the other wheel remains over-torqued to 140nm where’s the spec is 110  don’t check it with your torque wrench set at 110nm and then tell me it’s ok - you need to loosen the nuts off first and then do it again properly  to the correct torque  god almighty they’ve had their chance  and another  so suffice it to say i will not be darkening their doorstep again  it’s a shame  because their choice of tyres is good and sometimes you just need something respectable  mid-range  not ultra-premium  in a tyre  it would never happen  because their prices for the latter e g  michelin  are higher than costco  but theoretically i could have been going to  and spending £1200+ on 4 tyres for one of my other cars  not £150 on 2    and would it have been amateur night on that visit also  i’m sorry to say that i think so
