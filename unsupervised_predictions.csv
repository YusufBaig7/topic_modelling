"I've used [REDACTED] previously several times for tyre purchase and fitting for three of my cars and each time the service has worked seamlessly and very efficiently. On a previous occasion, I needed to contact their CS dept. and was rapidly and properly served by a helpful, professional and friendly UK agent. Lots of companies could potentially sell tyres only online but [REDACTED].com also have the UK national fitting service options fully covered. So each time, as now, I purchased tyres from [REDACTED].com and ordered a fitting service from ATS Euromaster at our branch in Knutsford (incidentally those friendly guys there, Mark & Andy, are always excellent and bang on time). The fact that [REDACTED].com deliver exactly the tyre you order online to your chosen fitting depot and it's always there for when you arrive for the fitting is great. In short, it all works without any fuss or issue. Plus importantly, the [REDACTED] prices have always been the most competitive (online or offline); with or without the fitting element. So they tick every box, imho. Did I miss anything?!

"This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED]. The process of choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me. The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms. The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know. Prices are slightly cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.

"Initial appointment delayed due to courier losing one of my tyres, rescheduled appointment was not suitable for me as I required my car for that time to travel over 100 miles, which I explained in my email, I was emailed back saying it was the earliest appointment I could get. This resulted in me then phoning during my working hours, to be told I could get my appointment changed to the following day after my initial one, which was more suitable. I was also told the missing tyre would be tracked to make sure it was delivered the following day. Lunchtime the following day my appointment was changed again but to the day after I required my car for! This again resulted in me having to make another phone call and to be told my second tyre was not yet delivered but should be at the site that afternoon. I managed to get the third appointment which was confirmed the day before back, explaining that I needed at least one of the tyres changed. I dropped off my car the following morning at around 7.45 am to be told the second tyre had not yet arrived. My appointment was not until 2.00 pm, but one of the reasons I dropped it off earlier was to ensure the message about needing at least one of them to be done had been relayed appropriately from your company. I was told this was done however was struggling to believe that after being told 2 days before that my tyre would be tracked to ensure it was delivered in the following day.

Questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience. Firstly the purchasing experience was not great. I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.,"[(0, 0.04541464), (1, 0.016525634), (5, 0.75302005), (7, 0.0864669), (8, 0.032992598), (9, 0.06272246)]"

"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy's fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.","[(5, 0.62107426), (7, 0.36822575)]"

After 10 minutes of waiting I asked what was happening and they said they werent too sure as it was nothing to do with them because I bought through [REDACTED]. They then decided it was time to take my vehicle into the workshop and eventually after 50 minutes the job was done. I do not excpect to wait 50 minutes for 2 tyres to be replaced. Unfortunately they have let you down and would make me think twice about using you again.

They were also able to undertake 4 wheel alignment at 1/2 the price of my local small specialist Mercedes garage (not even the main dealer). The price was as good as any of the other online supplers. As I often find Y rated Dunlops were cheaper than W rated tyres. Perfectly legal to fitted higher rated tyres than minimum requirement. These were also MO fitment tyres","[(3, 0.1082404), (5, 0.309078), (7, 0.24024755), (9, 0.3325965)]"
"Great prices appalling organisational skills Would not use again. I needed tires fitted at the weekend as mine were severely worn according to my MOT and I had a number of journeys to make with some pretty appalling weather forecaster. A friend suggested I check out [REDACTED], the prices looked great and a good range of local garages (5 within 6 miles or so of me) so I went ahead and placed an order. The following day (Friday) I received an email from them saying they couldn't book me in on the Saturday at my chosen garage and the next available slot was the following Monday. I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded. No apology for the inconvenience or anything like that and then a follow up email asking me to review my conversation with someone I had never spoken with. I presume all the good reviews on here are people who haven't had an issue and everything has gone smoothly and all power to them, just beware that if something does go wrong with your order it seems you're stuffed trying to sort it out.","[(1, 0.02054797), (2, 0.010145798), (4, 0.027395653), (5, 0.8203516), (6, 0.037816584), (9, 0.0808219)]"

"I have used you in the past and had excellent service, the past company I had the tyres fitted at were excellent, but no longer one of your options for fitting now. I chose your premium fitter in Basingstoke, Formula One Auto - and they were awful. Their customer service was non existent. I phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked, they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed, but I probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do. With this I sent my husband to have the tyres fitted, so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed. They took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres, way longer than it should have for 4 tyres. I phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge, which, because I know about cars I knew to be rubbish, he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me, which I would get in a week. I then discovered the next day when I took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi. After 10 days I phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived. I was promised a call back, which never came. A week later I chased again, again promised a call back and again did not hear from them. A few days later I called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back, but still did not call. a few days later I eventually got the cheque refund through. The tyres themselves are good, but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars. Thankfully although my husband doesn't I do, it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people. So for that reason whilst I may still recommend [REDACTED] for tyres I would be very, very, very careful about who fits mine in the future and advise anyone else to be too.","[(2, 0.0664668), (5, 0.86041737), (7, 0.06838486)]"

"I looked at the [REDACTED] website and it seemed ideal - very competitive price , very local fitting and appeared that I could get my tyre replaced very quickly.I'd got a puncture on Saturday night so on Monday i tried to ge ta new tyre - the [REDACTED] website said first available date wednesday -i thought this was reasonable as i have had difficulty sourcing tyres before - I picked a very local garage and it came up with virtually every time slot available - I picked one and received an email with booking reference etc.... I assumed this meant it was booked.The next day I received an email and text saying to contact [REDACTED] urgently - which I did - I was told I couldn't have the appointment I had booked and on asking for an alternative appointment that day I was told there were NONE available - they were fully booked.

Rear driver side tyre low as tyre was leaking air. Also noticed the tyre fitters had damaged wheels. Had to drive to the fitters to sort out air leak and complained about fresh damage to wheels. Took abou half for them to sort wheels and decided I would complain in writing rather than confront the fitters as at the time I was and am fuming. - 15/08. MOT booked in with BMW. Car passed MOT. However I was advised that the front brake pad warning wire was hanging. Had to book car in again on the 18/08 to be rectified.19/08. BMW checked the front brake pad warning wire.

"Poor customer service. Well having used [REDACTED] before I opted to purchase some fully fitted tyres from them.Got the confirmation email and booking for fitting, so I took half day off work to allow, very late email arrives saying delay and so booking moved a day forward. So another half day booked and what another late email saying can’t actually get hold of tyres? I rang their customer services who had no sympathy at all for 2 half days being booked and they could offer me cheaper tyres at the same price of which I refused. I explained that my chosen tyres were still on sale on their website but for some reason were almost £20 more for each tyre, could this be the reason? Who knows, anyway I had to opt for different tyres to be fitted which meant another delay and more time off work. Also the tyres were cheaper and a refund is pending but nothing yet so I’ll have to contact them again 🙁","[(5, 0.9552991), (9, 0.03343136)]"

Not surprising when I inspected the 'Dot Date' and it was 4517 (ie tyres manufactured in week 45 of 2017.Queried this with [REDACTED] who told me that they have many different suppliers and do not check the age of the tyres.They could re-order but no guarantee that the replacements would be any newer.

The tyres themselves were good but [REDACTED] told me a specific time and when I went to the garage they’d received the tyres but not been told who for or when.

No notice of being unable to fit tyres offered fitting five days later. Ordered a Tyre for my daughters car as existing tyre irreparable. As no spare until replaced could not drive car. Ordered on Weds for fitting Saturday morning. Received an e mail at 7.51 am about feedback and another at 7.52 stating that the tyre could not be fitted on Saturday and the earliest date for fitting would be five days later on Weds. During this time my daughter would have no driveable car. She needed the car on Saturday. This meant I had little chance of finding a local tyre fitter to fit a tyre on the busiest morning of the week and certainly not at a competitive price.

"I booked my car in for 1 new tyre to be replaced, I was booked in for 10am, arrived 15 minuets early as requested ( both kids in tow) was told come back in 45 minuets it will be ready then. Came back after an hour, my car had not even been touched asked how much longer it was going to be, another hour at least! As you can imagine the kids are truly fed up so I had to get someone to pick us up. The guy said he will ring as soon as it was done, no one called, so I called them at 3pm still not done the car was eventually don’t at 3.50pm to me that is just terrible service so I will definitely not be using you again or recommending you to any friends.

Great if you want to wait 3 weeks. Have been trying to book in my tyre repair for weeks. Incredibly slow to respond. Originally I booked the tyre fitting on a Tuesday for the Saturday morning. They waited until just before 6pm on the Friday to let me know they actually can't do it on the Saturday. Have been going back and forth for two weeks. Asked if they can do the following Saturday to which they said we only have time on Monday. Ended up just calling the garage like you either have the tyre or not?

Phone them the next day, waited 10 minutes before I was answered and apologised to me saying that I can get them fitted on Friday at the same time as my Wednesday appointment had been. Friday comes and I get to the fitter who tells me that they have only had 3 tyres delivered of the 4 I ordered and paid for. I ended up having the three fitted and left the best one of the previous 4 on. I phoned them whilst I was at the fitter. They apologised again and said that they will refund the 4th tyre, Give me £20 off and also a 10% voucher for when next I use them. Of course that was just to fob me off and I only received the refund for the tyre.

"Trouble free from choosing to fitting. This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED].The process of comparing, choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. They have several top Brands and a large overall choice.And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me.You chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive. Supply them the order number and abit of information like which tyres you want replacing etc and then sit back and they'll deal with everything. You can leave a review of the garage afterwards to help others decide.You can even copy the appointment info straight into the calendar which is a nice touch. The app links to mapping services to direct you to the garage.If the garage offers other services you can order these aswell, but if there's a charge then you will have to pay that direct to the garage while there.The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms.The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know who can benefit from the service.Prices are competitive and I found them to be cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.If you don't require fitting then for a reduced price they will deliver the tyres straight to an alternative address.If you need to cancel your order for any reason then they don't question it or try to convince you not to. They simply issue a full refund. No pressure at all. Easy.My experience with [REDACTED] was excellent.

Best £6 i've ever spent.The tyres are brilliant so far, they were the cheapest option available in my size, and they are much better than my old Pirelli tyres.

The waiting room was dingy and dirty, the magazines elderly and torn, the coffee machine was out of cups and coffee pods. I did not try the loo as I was put off by the waiting room.

I had asked for the best of the 2 tyres to be put into my boot. so that I could keep it for emergency puncture replacement. I got home it was not there.

Overall, I'm really chuffed with the product (4 x Michelin Pilot Sport 4's) and the job the premier partner (Strathclyde Autotune) carried out.However, the customer service experience at [REDACTED] left a lot to be desired after it came to light I was consistently given incorrect information by email, and later on the phone.To cut a long story short, [REDACTED] appear to book jobs and services for you on their own system without consulting the garage you choose and their schedule for that given day.I booked a tyre fitting for 4 new tyres and selected some additional services.I was never given an appointment time. Similarly, the services I selected were split across a Friday and a Monday.Not the end of the world..but the tyre fitting was scheduled for Friday and TPMS Sensor Valve Replacement was scheduled for the Monday.For me it made more sense to fit the sensors on Friday whilst the wheels are already coming off to fit the tyres?Anyway, I phoned to challenge this aspect and to double check why I wasn't given an appointment time.I was told adamantly that the garage operated on a first-come-first-serve basis and that they couldn't provide the additional services I asked for.I struggled to see the value in this system over scheduled appointments; but I went along with it as I had already paid for the tyres.Cut To: Me the next day getting up super early to be the first person in this first-come-first-serve queue.After arriving at the garage before the staff, I thought it was odd that no other people were rushing to get there first?Turns out that the garage has an appointment book, and [REDACTED] tell you it's first-come-first-serve, and split your services across a weekend for no other reason than to cause total inconvenience?The garage was great though!..

"The company that only puts itself first never the customer.

[REDACTED] have remained totally unappreciative of that lost holiday and great inconvenience. Indeed they have made no acknowledgment of this complaint whatsoever -that is how much they respect customers and value a customer's time. [REDACTED] have a diabolical level of customer care that not only completely ignores any complaint you might make or loss suffered, but also will take atleast 24 hours to offer you any response at all (making rescheduling even more inconvenient). I had to schedule the appointment myself directly with the fitter as [REDACTED] proved utterly redundant as any support or help in this way. It was then my horror to experience their recommended fitter (Johnsons Motors) jack up my car incorrectly (despite my clear and polite request the fitter confirm with me where to jack my car before raising it). I had to shout at the unresponsive engineer to lower my car immediately upon noticing (only by chance) their incompetence. The fitter then proved argumentative, dishonest before shouting their refusal to do any further work at all -despite the fact the work was already paid for via [REDACTED]. I have made yet another complaint to [REDACTED] for this further diabolical low level of quality product and customer service offered via their company -who have again sought to ignore this complaint as well. They have also so far ignored my fair and rightful request of a full refund.

Totally unacceptable. It was too late to contact [REDACTED] then so we phoned Saturday morning and was told the fitter would come that morning as arranged. We agreed to that but said we had to travel to Manchester at lunchtime. No-one had turned up by 11.45 so we phoned again and was told fitter would be with us by 1.00-1.15. Still no show, so phoned again at 2.00pm and was told he would be with us by 3.00pm. Still no show so we left home, making alternative travel arrangements and being disappointingly late for the event we had planned.

"2 new tyres and a lot of waiting around. The purchase and arrangement of 2 new tyres for fitting at a convenient local garage was good. The price was a noticeable saving, and the pre-arranged fitting time meant I was expected at the garage reception. So far so good, with full marks to [REDACTED] at this point. My question from this point on is: how come it took the garage over an hour and a quarter to actually fit the tyres ? Ok, they were diligent enough to check all the wheels before they started, and reported unusual tyre wear on the fronts - for which we agreed to check the alignment. But the alignment check and adjustment was only carried out after the aforementioned 1.25hrs, and trhe end result was a 2 hour visit. For 2 tyres. On a prearranged 1/2 hr slot. With 5 days notice. This to me is unacceptable - some people also have jobs to go to, and I wasn't anticipating this chunk of time taken out of my working day.If Red Bull's F1 team can do it in 1.88 seconds with half a lap's notice , how come a major national chain can be as slovenly as this ? Not impressed. I will use [REDACTED] again, but not, to name names, ATS.

I went to a different garage later that day as I needed the fronts urgently and couldn’t wait for your delivery time and they used a nut gun and didn’t removed the old wheel weights before balancing.

Price was good and choice of fitting locations is helpful. Generally satisfied with [REDACTED].Just 2 issues:- Once a fitting service is selected you are given a calendar to select the day and time. Having selected an early morning time for my convenience at the designated supplier i was contacted later and told the time selected wasnt available. That was less convenient.The supplier selected was the nearest & most convenient but they were a mainstream BMW garage and not a specialist tyre fitter. They were clearly more focused on their BMW customers and despite clear instructions fitted the replacement tyre on the wrong wheel. This was apologetically rectified but resulted in the fitting of one tyre taking 2 hours. Instead of being fitted and on my way by 9-00 am as originally planned it was gone 12-00 when the job was completed.,"[(2, 0.024486942), (5, 0.6524361), (7, 0.03210106), (9, 0.28062877)]"

"Unfortunately, you can't beat their prices, but I've had some mixed experiences, and I'm struggling to trust the honesty / integrity of the company as a whole.1) I booked a fitted service for my wife's car, and was given a timed appointment, which was really inconvenient (no choice of times), so I called customer service to see if it could be changed ""let me check with the garage"" said the lady on the phone, followed by ""the garage has no other availability on that day"", etc, etc. So I called the garage directly and explained that I'd like to come earlier if possible and got ""no problem sir, come along for when we open, and we'll get you straight in""... did customer service actually speak with the garage, given how accommodating they were when I called, I doubt it!2) Different garage, and 4 tyres for my car... I had a very poor experience where it apparently took the garage 2 hours 10 minutes to change 4 tyres, and a very muddled experience from start to finish... they didn't have my paperwork, couldn't find my tyres, were questioning whether I was there on the right day, etc. and then the length of time to actually change the tyres, whilst mechanics floated aimlessly around the garage doing nothing. I took the time to write a detailed review of the garage on the [REDACTED] website, but that review hasn't been published weeks on, and the garage still has a 5 star rating, leading me to believe that [REDACTED] are trying to protect the reputation of their premier partner garages despite customer experiences.","[(1, 0.053115085), (5, 0.88792896), (9, 0.052350737)]"

"I ordered a Dunlop SP Sport Maxx 255/45 R17 W (98) tyre for my Mercedes on the [REDACTED] website. As usual, I took a screen-shot of the 'Order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records. Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [REDACTED] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run-flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx. I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run-flat version. Even after I emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre. (Sub-text; another stupid customer!)I have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [REDACTED] may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'Order Confirmation' screen. After you enter a tyre number (AND the vehicle that the tyre is for!), the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size. The large, headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre (in my case 'Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT' followed by some generic (and therefore worthless) 4 and 5-star reviews. Between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos. All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon, presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane. Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari etc as well as 'Run Flat', and MO. There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to.","[(0, 0.04132446), (5, 0.6187426), (6, 0.31388584), (9, 0.022803105)]"

"The website, which I have used before - was great. On the day, the garage was not. I was using a different garage to usual, to be nearer my partner's home.She reported that the small garage in a quiet village gave veryy bad customer service.

"Ordering the tyres online and getting them delivered was absolutely fine and they would get 5 stars for this. However the issues I had with the garage (F1 Autocentres - Gloucester) after is the reason this gets a low star rating.I was originally booked in for a Saturday. I turn up, after getting a reminder of my booking via text I might add. The garage didn't have any fitters to do my tyres. They were sick. So I was a bit annoyed they couldn't have informed me before I left. But I don't blame them for people calling in sick. I was asked to come back on Sunday.So I turn up on Sunday @ 11am and since I didn't need the car I was happy to leave it there all day. Was told to come back at 4pm. I come back and they have not even started my car. I had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn't do the tracking I had requested with it. The only positive, and why I gave 2 stars and not 1. Is they offered to do the tracking for free.Had to go back on Tuesday. I turn up on time as requested, but they are not ready, ask me to come back in 45 minutes. So I do that, have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen. At the end they only did the front tracking. So I had to go back again on Wednesday. This time I was seen within 20 minutes of arriving.But overall the service was not good. Having to go back 4 times just to have 2 tyres fitted and tracking. I will not be using that garage again. Unfortunately for [REDACTED], I am running out of garages to try with them and get a good service. So I might soon be looking to get my tyres elsewhere.","[(0, 0.018019559), (1, 0.016847635), (5, 0.95768476)]"

"This was my first time trying [REDACTED].com. I was desperate to get some tyres for the next day after picking up a puncture on the Thursday and having a weekend trip leaving on the Friday night and it's amazing how hard it is to get decent sport tyres for the next day as no-one carries stock. I'd first tried making a booking with Kwik Fit mobile fittings, they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back. The only other place I could find was [REDACTED].com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage. It seemed too good to be true, HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next Tuesday yet [REDACTED] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price. The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing. The appointment was first thing the next morning, tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done. It does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like National to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days, plus the price is very good, so I will certainly look to [REDACTED].com again in the future.","[(0, 0.047814913), (1, 0.044773936), (5, 0.7355596), (9, 0.16553448)]"

"I had shopped around for some tyres for my car and [REDACTED] are a similar price to that of a few other companies, however I thought I would give them a go on the basis I can order online and have them fitted at home or work making it much easier. It’s far from easy however. I had booked for a mobile fitter to come out to me (had to pay a surcharge for this of £6) on a Saturday which at that point was a week away, I selected a pm slot. No details were given not any confirmation as to when pm is other than after 12. I waited in all afternoon then the garage called me around 3pm and stated [REDACTED] had delivered 2 different tyres and therefore could no longer fit them. I called [REDACTED] and was on hold for 10mins before someone eventually admired the mistake. They apologised and said I would get some compensation and would arrive in 3/5 days. The tyres have since been fitted and 2 weeks on the compensation has not arrived. I try calling and always on hold for ages.

Tyres and [REDACTED] service and price was good . I didn't have confidence with the fitters. I asked them to torque the wheel bolts to 170NM. They said this was too tight but I insisted.

"First time using [REDACTED] and it was a pleasure. Had just bought a spare wheel which needed a tyre. I didn't want to pay the normal price as I had just had to buy one.The [REDACTED] Web site was easy to use and gave the option of a few budget tyres. I shose the cheapest as it is only a spare and ordered it having chisel one of their premier fitters. The fitting time came through which was not convenient so called [REDACTED] who quickly rearranged the time for me.Turned up and immediately the wheel was taken, the new tyre fitted and balanced and then bought back to the car and put in the boot. Great service all round and will definitely use them again and have already spread the word. I ebded up paying just lass than a third of the price of the originally fitted one.","[(2, 0.02632201), (5, 0.56645805), (7, 0.10816225), (9, 0.28834045)]"

"Kind of feel strange leaving this review since I purchased from them based on the Truspilot's generally great feedback for this company...The appointment cancelled by a text. Alright, I thought.. this happens... The cancellation text followed by a polite email from one of their representatives... - 'We are working on it' etc.... Good, they are taking care of it... Unfortunately, no follow up the next day. An email sent to them.. and another one. Still no reply... - Right, looks like I will need to ring them, I thought. After 10 min of waiting finally managed to get through, but the line was so bad I was transferred to another call... 10 min... 15 min... no answer. I had to hang up and go back to work...I am selling my car and promised the guy I will put a new set of tyres on her... I know [REDACTED] doesn't care, but if they tell me they can get those fitted in two days and get good online reviews - well that's why I am buying from them and not elsewhere. I am kind of seriously stuck here because of them!***UPDATE***An email eventually came saying the tyres have been delivered and asking me if I had been aware of it and already had them fitted(???).... I replied saying noone let me know anything and I'm still awaiting for the appointment to be rescheduled. Guess what? No reply again. The next morning I decided I'm not going to deal with them via email any more, and just headed (without an appointment) to the garage in question and asked if they had received my tyres (they had). Explained what'd been going on and fortunately they kindly agreed to fit them for me. I'm not sure if this was just an isolated example of poor case handling by [REDACTED] or this is the way they treat their customers in general, should something go wrong.I normally don't have time for this sort of rubbish (unanswered emails, waiting in a phone queue for ages). You normally get a pretty decent customer service nowadays and its KEY to build good reputation for online retailers. Not good.*********************Hi TomI am really sorry for this issue.No, you are not. You don't care and only leave this comment here to make it look as if you care.

"Great prices and buying experience but queries take a while to be resolved. On the whole my experience with them is great. The only reason I’ve given them 4 stars is due to how difficult it is to reach their customer services, by email only in my experience which goes to a central mailbox, once it’s there you are dealt with - not necessarily with the same person throughout the query and it took a couple of days to settle my query with emails going back and forth - but it does get sorted.

"I had 4 new Yokohama Tyres which I had installed on 21st December. I brought the vehicle back to the fitting centre a couple of days later. As two of the tyres keep deflating, the fitting centre checked the tyres and could not find a puncture on either of the tyres. So there was no charge for this service, they did tighten the valves. I have had this problem ongoing ever since, and have had no response from [REDACTED].com I have emailed and tweeted them!!!Clearly two of these tyres must be faulty, and should be replaced by Balckcircles.

"First time order from [REDACTED].Tyres ordered fine and I was offered an or pm. Chose pm thinking it meant I could go anytime in the afternoon to get tyres replaced. Day later got email with time I was expected at fitters. Emailed back to say that I couldn’t do the time given due to work and that 4:30 to 6pm would be best if possible. Email came back later the same day with a 5pm time slot. Got to tyre fitters and they said they could not get wheels off to change tyres due to stripped locking wheel but key. Said they couldn’t do it as they closed at 6pm and it was now 5:45pm. They requested I get lockers removed and then come back. I asked about making another appointment and they told me it would be an issue holding the tyres or getting them fitted when I got back. The next day I was able to get one of the nuts off by myself but was unable to get other off. Went to another garage over weekend who got it off. Took car back to tyre fitters and they fitted new tryres without a problem. So moral of this story, check you locking wheel nuts before taking you car in to get the tyres replaced.","[(5, 0.89387226), (7, 0.0961267)]"

Yes, I know what it says in the (very) small print but when it says ""discount"" in size 60 font and ""subject to terms and conditions"" in size 6 font and you can only find the terms and conditions in the bottom of locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a notice on the door saying ""beware of the leopard"" it doesn't quite give the impression that you'd expect of a straightforward business.

"Pretty poor experience overall. [REDACTED] delayed my tyres by a few days beyond when it was agreed they would be fitted. When tyres were eventually fitted they were the wrong size and having driven my car, I damaged my two alloys. Nothing was offered by way of compensation other than the meaningless ‘sincere apologies’. They did offer to fix my alloys and have them them re cut (which I have to organise and submit quotes etc) but nothing else. When the correct tyres were due to be fitted they again delayed the order and I’m hoping (but not holding my breath) that the correct tyres will be fitted tomorrow. I’ve had my car sitting in my drive for several days waiting for [REDACTED] to rectify their error. I hoped putting a customer out by a week might concern them but it really doesn’t. In summary they put themselves forward as a friendly, quirky service with their customer servers and personal bios stating they live in Edinburgh and enjoy watching TV, spending time with family and hillwalking. While they enjoy things like this, it’s pretty clear they don’t give one care about providing a good service and carrying out a simple task such as delivering and fitting a tyres. I will never be using them again. If you live in the Highlands just go anywhere else, regardless of the cost.

"Purchased on the behalf of a vehicle workshop. Order placed on Monday at 11.55am for 2 tyres at over £400, promised delivery of Tuesday next day. I received an apologetic email and a voicemail outside of office hours at 5.35pm Monday, that stated the tyres would not arrive Tuesday but Wednesday instead. Contacted [REDACTED] on the phoneline on Thursday PM after realising that we had not yet had a delivery. The call handler explained that there had been a courier issue and that the tyres could not be supplied until the following Monday, 7 days after initial order. They were apologetic that I had not been contacted but couldn't offer an explanation as to why I was not informed that delivery would be delayed. Although the call handler was apologetic, it was explained that these tyres were for a client vehicle and had caused a delay in it being returned to the customer. I was offered 10% discount on next order, which I did not accept. As a gesture of goodwill it is lovely but doesn't help with the current issue & let down client. I have now sourced the tyres elsewhere, which have been delivered on Friday (today). It has taken 13mins on hold at peak time to cancel the order, (please change the on hold music :) !) but credit to both call handlers who chased the order, courier, and cancelled the order. Both very professional and did their best to assist. Just a shame that we haven't been looked after as a business in this instance","[(1, 0.01608637), (5, 0.80314237), (7, 0.17362738)]"

I booked my tyre change for a complete set of tyres for an Aston Martin DB9. The appointed garage was excellent and the service was superb. My complaint is that the tyres I received were date stamped 2017 therefore were at least 2 years old. Upon complaining about this to [REDACTED] directly I was informed that these tyres are not pressed often and therefore up to date tyres could not be guaranteed. Unfortunately due to time commitments I was unable to reschedule my fitting and had to go ahead with the 2017 tyres. The car does not do a big mileage and therefore I have paid for tyres that are already at least two years short on their life cycle due to the natural degradation of the rubber compound.

The ordering process is very easy to use and convenient. It allows you to book a fitting at the nearest garage. I placed the order on Wednesday for a Friday fitting. On Thursday afternoon I received an email stating there was an issue delivering my tyre to the garage and that my fitting was being rebooked to Tuesday. I had to phone [REDACTED] as I had already made arrangements and taken time off work to have the fitting on Friday. I am reliant on my vehicle for transport to work and of course this meant that I would be without a vehicle for another 4 days!. [REDACTED] were unable to keep the Friday booking and I was offered a small compensation by the rep on the phone. I kept the booking on Tuesday as the tyre which I ordered was only available through [REDACTED]. Come Tuesday there was no further problems the garage I chose was spot on. I awaited the compensation to be refunded back. Another week goes by and there was no sign of any compensation or any communication. So I rang [REDACTED] who told me there was no note on their system regarding me being given any compo.This was sorted the following day and I did receive the amount promised.Overall I would say this was a rough ride ordering from [REDACTED]. It's a shame they are failing at such little things and leave you stranded. The whole point of ordering a tyre from the internet is so that it is convenient and reliable.

"The actual purchasing and delivery of my four new Cross climate tyres from [REDACTED] went smoothly enough. My problems started when the partner garage (Auto Pfect at Wath on Dearne) could not accommodate me on the date I booked on line and I therefore had to rearrange it and wait a further week as it needed to be a weekend. The tyres seemed to be fitted fine but I had to ask them to find my locking wheel nut key as it was not in the car. A few days later I took my car to the Kia dealership for mot and service. The car failed because the tyre on the rear drivers side had been fitted the wrong way round!! Apparently the tyres are directional. Kia sorted out the tyre for a cost and passed the car and the garage who fitted the tyres reimbursed me for that cost. I chose Auto Pfect because [REDACTED] rated them as a premium fitter, and despite the staff being friendly and generally helpful, the mistakes made were very basic and avoidable for a professional tyre fitting garage. I certainly wouldn't trust them to provide other services and will stick to the trusted main Kia dealer.","[(1, 0.051842183), (2, 0.075532116), (3, 0.022922957), (4, 0.022638949), (5, 0.7695836), (7, 0.052540656)]"

"Not very interested. I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles, my second visit through [REDACTED] and they are absolutely fantastic! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The reason for the poor rating is this, before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik. I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [REDACTED] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection. I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day. Looking at the [REDACTED] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location, so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later, only to be told to collect the car in four hours time. Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best. I spoke to [REDACTED] about this and, while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price, they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged. I felt like a second class customer for using [REDACTED] in Penicuik, if the conditions were made plain on the website, I would have been able to make a different choice. Worse was the fact that [REDACTED] customer relations were not interested in addressing what I think is a real issue.Incidentally I did not bother with the discount as I was delighted with the service I received in Peebles.","[(0, 0.013631781), (3, 0.14703728), (4, 0.04164892), (5, 0.6563244), (9, 0.13708328)]"

Got put through to escaltion team who took another 10 minutes to answer.The only thing that was reasonable was the manner in which the complaint team approached the complaint however the best they could do is offer a refund plus £30 and a 10% discount on future purchases. The extra £30 did not even cover the additional costs that I incurred but at least they were polite and sypathetic and agreed to feed back that a phone call so late in the day would have been appropriate to give me some options..

I couldn't take a pressure reading so something was affecting the valve. The valve was fiddled with and I was told to come back the next day when Phil was there.Contacted [REDACTED] CS and was told I'd get a quick callback.However all I got was an email on the Tuesday with all the reasons why a TPMS might fail and to go to the garage.On returning on Tuesday Phil was there, straight away removed the tyre, and it was clear the TPMS must have been damaged during the fitting and then shearing whilst driving at motorway speeds.

"I've bought several motorcycle tyres from [REDACTED] and always thought the service and value were good.However the front of the pair of motorcycle tyre I bought on the last occasion was defective. The tyres were fitted and balanced by my very experienced tyre man but I discovered that at speeds over 45mph the handlebars oscillated and this worsened until by 60mph it was unbearable. Tyre man removed, refitted and rebalanced the tyre but problem remained. Tyre man spotted that the tyre did not run true, the carcass was distorted. Tyre man fitted an old tyre and all was well, thus proving the new tyre was faulty. This was reported to [REDACTED] and they replaced the tyre and took the defective tyre for analysis. This at no cost to myself.That is brilliant and gives me great confidence to continue using [REDACTED]. First class customer service!

Excellent price service. Recently bought 2 new tires from [REDACTED].com & was very pleased with the price which was much cheaper than I could find any where else. Gave several places for the fitting service near me which was done as soon as we arrived & back on the road within 25 minutes. Only issue we had was that the tire pressure warning light was on after fitting. They said it will go out when I start driving but it did not. Stopped at a petrol station & found the new tires were well below the correct pressure. Perhaps if they are not sure of the pressure then they should ask the customer. Not a big issue & easily resolved. Highly recommend & wont hesitate to look there when I need anymore tires.,"[(1, 0.06531502), (2, 0.06822393), (5, 0.6967686), (9, 0.15878123)]"

"The whole process went like clockwork. The only slight concern I have, is that prior to the new tyres having been fitted, there were no problems with my steering wheel. Having had the new tyres, when I reached 70mph on the motorway, I had steering wheel vibration. I assumed that there needed to be an adjustment with the balancing. I rang up and arranged to take the car back with no problems. ""Tommy""went to check the off side front wheel first, and then changed his mind and did the near side. It was slightly out. He then did the off side and immediately he put the wheel on the balancing machine, he said the wheel was buckled and there was nothing he could do. He showed me the buckle and asked if I had hit a pot hole. (I had not) It was almost as if he knew what he was going to find. Somehow, it did not add up and I am now having to get the wheel straightened or at worst, get a new one.","[(0, 0.050765924), (5, 0.45197415), (7, 0.48578334)]"

"Booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as I wanted to keep the tyres already on the car. The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland. We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM. At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening? I spoke to [REDACTED] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday. I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn't trust them but they did. The following Saturday arrived and once again, no one showed. I called [REDACTED] who called the tyre fitters. Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment. The problem is that there is a big issue with the tyre fitters they use/in general and I would not recommend whatsoever, having your tyres mobile fitted in the Leeds/Bradford area as this is the only mobile tyre fitter [REDACTED] use.","[(0, 0.011430577), (2, 0.04111856), (5, 0.9276149), (7, 0.015725447)]"

Fitting garage said they can get the tyres for the following day so I cancelled the [REDACTED] order and told the garage to order them in. They were paid for the tyres almost a week earlier but told me a refund would take 3-5 days. Told them this wasn't acceptable and the refund must be made that day.

"I have previously used [REDACTED] a few years ago with no problems so decided to use them again. Booking 4 new tyres for my Audi Q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘recommended’ garage, so far so good.So turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “the car wash is outside”, after pointing out I was there for 4 new tyres was told “oh sorry” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay. So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it?Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing, their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38 (approx as can’t remember exactly). After the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking, and the special price of £38 (I check my tyres regularly and had not seen any signs of uneven wear) so declined ......... call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking? Seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £38 out of people.So after approx 1hr 15 mins I left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok.Not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up. 4 days & less that 75 miles later I got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi.Moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the F/N/S wheel has a nut missing, the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the F/O/S wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers.I immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced BUT as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now I have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover. The managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should I settle for second bast. My car was in purse to condition when I went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy!!Overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and I would never use them again.

"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.","[(5, 0.6060466), (7, 0.38093263)]"

As it was a home fitting I’d taken the day off!!!!I was then told they could get four of the tyres for me by the following Tuesday and the fifth by the Friday. Great thought I.Well, I got my four tyres fitted on the Tuesday. No problem.Thursday afternoon came at at about 5.30pm I got an email from BC stating they couldn’t get my 5th tyre and “how did I want to proceed”.Livid????

Very helpful and polite lady understood my frustrations but went on to tell me that the tyre I’d ordered, paid for and expected to be fitted that morning couldn’t be obtained and BC didn’t know when they’d get some in.

"2x Bridgestone Potenza S001 285/30R19 Merc OnlyPROS:1) (easily) Best fitted price available anywhere2) Fitted at a local trader I know3) Customer Service was excellent in fixing a problem with the orderCONS:NONE!I bought 2 pretty expensive tyres for my Merc CLS. I’d had Bridgestones on my summer wheels for over 40,000 miles on the rears. I’ve been running Winter Wheels and tyres and when I had to get my summer wheels back on and the rears replaced, I tried [REDACTED] (BC). Having bought tyres online for the last 3 sets of tyres, I found BC to be the cheapest available for what is quite an unusual size. Add to this there was a 10% off flash sale that day and the price was considerably cheaper than TyreLeader. The wheels and tyres were fitted by a local tyre dealer I know. Unfortunately when I got home, I realised that one of the tyres was not a Mercedes Only(MO) tyre. The difference between the standard tyre and the MO is that the MO tyre has a significant 2cm flange that protects my lovely AMG 19in rims. I often say that you only know what a company is like until there is a problem. The resolution of the problem is the mark of how good the company is. BC went above and beyond:I contacted BC and they were fantastic. As I work in London, and I’m busy at the moment, it took me a little while to get round to taking photos for BC’s reference. However, despite having travelled over 700 miles since fitting, BC have arranged for the tyre to be replaced with the correct one. Additionally, BC gave me a generous goodwill gesture as recognition of my inconvenience. I will not only buy all my future tyres from them, but I will also highly recommend them to my family and friends. If all companies treated their customers with the efficiency, courtesy and genuine desire to provide a good service, as BC do, the world would be a better place!

"My first experience was great really straight forward fitter was really friendly, I did not hesitate to go back for my next purchase, unfortunately the fitter I had used before was busy so I chose another local one all seemed great.Then I get an email informing me my chosen fitter is unable to accomodate my tyre size, fine but if so they really should remove them as an option when you buy that size tyre.I was offered another fitter further away probably the only one available that day but I did not wish to drive too far with a tyre that could deflate at any time, I tried to decline the suggestion but this was ignored and the booking made, I did not have the time whilst working to be messed about I gave up and requested a refund.I had time off the following week so I decided to try once more to get the tyres sorted only to be misled by the search engine metadata and my own eagerness for a bargain, I was in too much of a hurry and thought I had finally found a real bargain, I did not check properly and I bought a smaller size 18 inch instead of 19 inch.I noticed as soon as I got the confirmation email and sent an email requesting the size change and to cancel the fitting date. obviously I would have to pay the difference.An email arrived confirming the fitting time so I sent another email requesting contact, 5 hours later I got another email (this is quick but seems like forever when you need something sorting)the email informed me I wanted to change the tyres I had already bought to the same ones really? why on earth would anyone want that? again they are not reading emails, I responded correcting the mistake.The following day I had heard nothing regarding the change and the appointment was due that day, I then received a text informing me my appointment was due in 30 minutes.I sent another email asking for urgent contact.Hours later still nothing.I then spent around ten minutes on hold only to be politely informed that someone would phone me back in a few hours.They did as promised phone me back and finally I got a person who listened, I explained my mistake she quickly sorted it explained the extra cost and booked the day and time for me.The fitter Mckinnon Motors was great again really quick and courteous.It is such a shame a hassle free way of getting a good deal on tyres is marred by poor communication skills.When it works it really works, when something goes wrong it can be a challenge.","[(0, 0.010044644), (4, 0.010596765), (5, 0.91691154), (9, 0.050233442)]"

"This is not a review of [REDACTED].com as such but my experience of the garage booked through them (A&S MOT Ltd).A terrible experience meaning I will never use A&S MOT Ltd again. Details of the issues are below.- Arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4-wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside- Took time off work and waited at garage. Work done and was given paperwork. Wheels dirty - but as expected- Left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- Got to work and checked values on paperwork. Rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- Left work early and returned to garage. Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- Rang Audi to ask about part required etc. and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage, both front AND rear- Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm. They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc.- Took more time off work to return to A&S as agreed. Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- When finished told ""all done"" - given no paperwork. Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there. Rear STILL not adjusted- Asked for an explanation. Wasn't given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN- I then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me. I checked the dash cam. Found out it had been moved to point at the sky. Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON’T use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety.","[(1, 0.02695446), (5, 0.67679155), (7, 0.29176635)]"

"I’ve bought dozens of Michelin tyres from Costco (very professional tyre-fitting) but on this occasion I just wanted some mid-range tyres for 20yr old (but 80,000) Volvo V70 T5 that we keep sentimentally along with the other car that my dad owned when he died 5yrs ago. Chose Kumho’s as I’d bought a 2nd hand BMW with these on a few years ago and they seemed OK. Existing Avon (ZV-7’s(?)) only 20% worn / 2 years old, but showing extensive micro-cracking to sidewalls. (Incidentally: Seen this before on Avon’s put on the kids’ cars, so consequently wouldn’t touch these again).Responded to customer satisfaction email from [REDACTED] commenting that jobsheet disclosed that fitters has seriously over-torqued wheelnuts (140Nm vs. 110Nn), suggesting they might want to look at their QC/spec. on this. By the time I got a response, requesting a copy of the jobsheet, it had become clear that one of the fitted tyres was not holding pressure, so advised this additionally, when sending copy jobsheet Invited to return to fitting depot to rectify. Unfortunately, return visit was an absolute object lesson in how NOT to deal with a customer service issue, particularly in a business where the customers need to be assured of the professionalism of the service with which they are being provided, not least because it impacts directly on their safety.So:- (Manager) Don’t moan to me as soon as I arrive that you’ve “been dealing with nothing but problems all day!”. I don’t care. I just want you to do what should have done properly with my car in the first place.- (Fitter) Crack the wheel nuts off with the tyre on the ground, not against the auto gearbox-“Park”. This is car DIY, page 1. Unbelievable!- (Manager) Don’t tell me that “often old cars leak from the rims”, inferring there’s nothing to be done in that case. I drove more than a million miles a bought maybe a hundred tyres before you were even born sonny and know perfectly well that there will often be slight corrosion on the bead seat of even a very new alloy wheel, and this is capable of compromising the integrity of the air seal. Any tyre fitter who knows his salt will inspect the rim, note this, and, as necessary, wire brush or even file this smooth.- (Manager) When faced with my sceptical look about “leaky rims”, don’t then pathetically backtrack and suggest kerbing, or a pothole as the culprit (what, in the 20 miles since fitting?!) The rim was not inspected and properly prepared for fitting and that’s all there is to it. - (Fitter) Tighten the wheenuts down in a star pattern, not a circle. And do the same with each of the nuts. Just because there are 5, you don’t have to forget to torque down the 5th! I watched you! - (Fitter) Having been told the other wheel remains over-torqued to 140Nm where’s the spec is 110, don’t check it with your torque wrench set at 110Nm and then tell me it’s OK - you need to loosen the nuts off first and then do it again properly, to the correct torque! God Almighty!They’ve had their chance, and another, so suffice it to say I will not be darkening their doorstep again. It’s a shame, because their choice of tyres is good and sometimes you just need something respectable, mid-range, not ultra-premium, in a tyre. It would never happen, because their prices for the latter,e.g. Michelin, are higher than Costco, but theoretically I could have been going to [REDACTED] and spending £1200+ on 4 tyres for one of my other cars, not £150 on 2...
